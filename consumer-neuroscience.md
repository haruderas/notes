# Consumer Neuroscience and Neuromarketing

## What is Consumer Neuroscience?

- __A current overview of consumer neuroscience__

Neuromarketing or consumer neuroscience is a sub-area of neuroeconomics that addresses marketing relevant problems with methods and insights from brain research. "Consumer neuroscience" is the scientific proceeding, and neuromarketing is the application of those findings within the scope of managerial practice.

Neuroeconomics proposes an interdisciplinary approach and specifically examines the neural correlates of decision-making (Sanfey et al, 2006). The application of neurobiological methods such as EEG is not new in marketing research, but the direct observation of the reactions within the brain is now available through the use of steadily improving methods of imaging techniques, whilst in the past consumer research considered the human organism as a "black box" and could only make indirect inferences about the processes inside.

The determination of cortical areas that are stimulated during consumer decision processing is important for various reasons:

1. The approach of consumer neuroscience enables the researcher to reassess existing theories that theoretically assume different brain mechanisms by investigating the actual brain activations.
2. The observation of the total brain, rather than just measuring one signal, has the potential to yield new, unpredictable results, and enhances the exploratory character of consumer neuroscience.
3. The observation of brain activity can offer a more objective perspective, as self-assessment methods rely totally on the ability of the respondent to describe and reconstruct feelings and thoughts, and are therefore very subjective. After all, many effects in the human organism that influence behavior are not perceived consciously.
4. Participants hace little to no influence in the measuring of their brain behavior, which eliminates the effect of strategic behavior and social desirability on the participants's part.
5. The simultaneousness of measurement and experiment is an advantage, as some processes might not be atable over time and this can make it difficult to reconstruct them _ex-post_.

_Product policy_ includes all decisions that a company makes reggarding the market-driven composition of its offered services. A product range that satisfies the needs, demands and problems of the customer can be the key for sustainable corporate success. Conventional market research methods such as self-reports often do not yield the desired information about consumers' real opinion of a product, because people are generally not able to reconstruct and interpret their thoughts and feelings retrospectively.

An important part of product policy is the optimal design of a product according to the preferences of the customer. fMRI results showed that reward-related brain areas are activated by objects that have gained a reputation as status symbols through cultural conditioning signaling wealth and social dominance. These studies have also postulated that the relative activation in the ventral striatum can be seen as an indicator of how attractive a visual stimulus is evaluated to be. Assuming that there is a relation between product design and purchase decision, it can be hyphotesized that activity changes in the reward system of the brain induced by an attractive product design can partly be applied in order to predict purchasing behavior.

_Communication policy_ plays an increasingly decisive role in marketing, and in the future one important challenge for the marketing-mix instrument will be the psychological differentiation of brands.

Some studies have dealt with the short-term processing of advertisements. Advertisements that were rated as attractive by the subjects let to activation in brain areas associated with the integration of emotions in the decision-making process and the perception of rewards. Some concluded from these results that attractive ads can act as a rewarding stimulus. These studies also revealed that __positive facial expressions are an essential component of attractive advertisements__. See Aharon et al (2001) for a possible explanation. #TODO check studies on the effect of typical ad stimuli such as the schemes of childlike characteristics or puppies

On long-term memorization of brand information, it's been found that an advertisement is remembered better if it's connected with emotional images, in comparison to use of exclusively rational arguments. An experiment that induced suppression of emotions through beta-blockers showed an effect on recall and recognition of ads.

As far as brand loyalty goes, loyal customers seem to integrate emotions into the decision-making process in a more intense way, and their favorite brand can act a a behaviorally relevant rewarding stimulus. In contrast, this activation wasn't measurable for so-called "disloyal" participants. Thus, the authors of this study concluded that the use of emotional reinforcers in marketing can constitute the base for long-term customer retention. Through a learning process, positive experiences are combined with the (retail) brand, then stored in the memory of the customer and recalled for buying decisions.

The field of _brand research_ is concerned with examining the important influence of brand information on decision-making. A central topic is whether or not consumer decisions are influenced by brand information. Several studies have showed results that support the idea that only a person's favorite brand is able to emotionalize the decision-making process, triggering significant cortical activation in areas that have important functions in combining incoming information with background knowledge, as well as the integration of emotions into the decision-making process, and decreasing the activation of areas associated with working memory, planning and logic decisions. Other studies have suggested that brands might function as subconscious presentiments that influenced the decision-making process even before the participants began thinking about advantages of the cars.

There's also the concept of "brand personality", which refers to the use of product descriptions that correspond to human-like traits in advertisement. Research done in this area seems to support the conclusion that it's not possible to "transfer" human-like attributes to brands in an unlimited way, as the characterization of persons led to a higher activation than the caracterization of brands.

_Prominent brain structures and processes for consumer neurosciences_ are the reward system, punishment areas (it's not possible to accurately delineate the reward and the punishment system), and decision-making areas.

Emotions and their influence on consumer decision-making are an important contribution of customer neuroscience, as emotions play a central role in generating behavior. However, it's also necessary to keep into account that neuroimaging techniques are still quite imprecise, and investigating brain activations does not necessarily yield an understanding of how the brain works; all results have to be taken with a grain of salt, and the limitations of the procedure used acknowledged.

Consumer neurosciences has some limitations: it's very cost and time-intensive, and is associated with legal and moral considerations; the outcome of experiments to date needs to be further validated and expanded, because of the complex data analysis required, the relatively small number of existing studies, and the relatively simple experimental setting that is necessary to conduct brain imaging studies. Neuroimaging methods still only offer a relatively indirect measurement of cortical activity changes due to limitations in resolution. All results provided rely on the assumption that the measured activation is not a result of noise or other errors, as well as assumptions on the functions of the areas we see activation in.

- __Neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience: current understanding and the way forward__

Consumer neuroscience is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines psychology, neuroscience and economics to study how the brain is physiologically affected by advertising and marketing strategies. Though _consumer neuroscience_ and _neuromarketing_ are often used interchangeably in the marketing literature, the former refers to academic research at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology and marketing while the latter generally refers to practitioner or popular interest in neurophysiological tools - such as eye tracking, skin conductance, EEG, event-related potential and fMRI, which are used for conducting commercial market research. Consumer neuroscience is therefore a more rigorous version of neuromarketing, findings of which are embedded in theory.

The current consumer neuroscience studies, particularly those using fMRI, are focused on reverse inference (reasoning backward from specific brian activations to particular mental functions) or the correlational relationship between brain activations and specific consumer behavior or experience - and makes no assumptions about the underlying causal relationship.

The consumer neuroscience researchers currently study the consumer decision-making process in phases and therefore, as of now, there is no unified model of the mind which shows how sub-processes such as attention, memory and reward/aversion processing are integrated and function concurrently for decision-making and problem-solving (see Block at al 2015 #TODO).
