## Chapter 1: What Is Media Psychology?

The emergence of the Internet and other interactive media networks have forced us to reconsider our concept of mass media as a medium where communication is ostensibly unidirectional. This is only to be expected, because each medium shapes society by its own terms, so we can never have a universal definition of "media" - the concept is forever in a state of flux.

Media are effectively ciphers, empty of meaning, until we perceive some form of content, which is then treated as a message.

Every decade in the last 50 years has seen major devlopments in mass communications and media. Keeping a finger on the pulse of change is difficult when you are trying to discover universal truths about human nature. [...] The research has been conducted in response to calls for scientific evidence for the harmful influence of media, rather than an intellectual need to understand how media in general might influence behavior. As a result, studies have been devised that have the best chance of securing a statistically significant outcome for a causal relationship between violent media and aggressive behavior. Despite widespread agreement as to the shortcomings of muh experimental research on media violence, its legacy has been bequeathed to the media themselves, and to politicians, who continue to make unsubstantiated statements about the direct relationship between media violence and antisocial behavior.

## Chapter 2: Theoretical Issues in Media Research

The "media effects" tradition of research has probably had the greatest impact of all media research on public life in the last 50 years. Concerns about the negative psychological effects of media are so commonplace that they are barely questioned outside academia. [...] Behaviorism is at its most persuasive when children are concerned, and so it's not surprising that the most popular behaviorist media research was that carried out by Bandura, who found that children who had been exposed to violence, either live or recorded, performed significantly more aggressive acts. There are, however, many problems with these findings.

After behaviorism, the task facing psychology involved an attempt to open the "black box" postulated by behaviorists in place of the mind, or brain. Effects research subsequently developed along two separate paths: the physiological perspective and the cognitive perspective. Other researches working in the same tradition attempted to integrate these approaches, such as the theory of "excitation transfer", building on top of the two-factor model of emotion.

In many areas of media studies, the "effects" tradition has acquired a bad name, bracketed with psychology in general, being charged with "individualizing" media concerns and ignoring wider social and cultural contexts. [...] The term "influences" is more appropiate, because it implies a complex interplay of social and environmental factors on behaviorof which media is one part, whereas the term effects suggests, perhaps erroneously, that the causal relationship between media and human behavior can be studied in isolation.

_Cultivation theory_: a more global approach to media effects that regards media as a key element in cultural socialization as a whole, looking at the way in which individuals grow up in a society in which media help shape our understanding of the world.

### Uses and gratifications research

Uses and gratifications research (U&G) approaches individual differences instead, and its research draws on traditional psychological theory, but from the Maslow school of humanism rather than from behaviorism. In this approach, the viewer (or general media user) is in control, and rather than studying the person as a passive recipient of effects, U&G researches look at the _motives_  for using media and the _needs_ that media use gratifies. U&G research, above all else, studies how and why people use media in general. (pag. 23)

Papachrissi and Rubin (2000) examined the factors that were most likely to predict people's use of the Internet. They identified five motives:

- Interpersonal utility (online social interaction)
- A way of passing time
- Information seeking
- Convenience
- Entertainment

Some Internet users use the medium as a functional alternative to social interaction, particularly those who had difficulties in making friends and forming relationships in face-to-face communication.

Three key ways in which individuals develop "dependency relations" with media (the dependency theory of DeFleur and Ball-Rockeach, 1989):

- Media provides information that enables us to _understand_ the world, which at the level of "self-understanding" provides us with information about ourselves - it enables the creation of identities by allowing us to interpret our behavior and compare ourselves to others.
- We may depend on media for _orientation_, either in terms of action (deciding to go on a diet, or voting in an election) or interaction (how to deal with social situations).
- Media provides us with opportunities to _play_ (either for solitary relaxation, or social activity like visiting the cinema).

### The "active audience"

Rather than treating the media user as an isolated television viewer locked into dependency relationships with media, __audience theory__ sees media users as social groups that are strongly influenced by media, but - like U&G subjects - far from passive. Much audience reseach has focused on the cultural _meanings_ that user derive from media.

One ofbejctive of this school of thought was to replace the two-step flow concept of communication (sender-message-receiver) as the dominant model of media research with a _circuit_, in which information is encoded (e.g. using television production codes) and then decoded by the audience. The idea behind this model was that concepts such as two-step flow and the "hypodermic needle" theory of media effects treat messages as fixed by the sender, and reception processes as determined by the message content. Hall (1980) suggested that there are three ways in which audiences could "decode" media messages:

1. The _dominant_ code, by which viewers select the "preferred reading" intended by the producers.
2. The _negotiated_ code, by which audiences modify the message, perhaps on the basis of personal experience.
3. The _oppositional_ code, by which the message is treted with deep suspicion, as biased estabilishment propaganda.

Research (Morley, 1980) has suggested that the social and cultural characteristics of the audience partly dictate which form of encoding they will use.

Some authors have asserted that the circuit model can perhaps be applied to news and current affairs media (because it was designed with this sort of material in mind), but offers inappropiate explanations for audience response to popular cultural material, such as soap opera and pop music.

Some of the most exciting research in the active audience tradition is Henry Jenkins' work on fandom, which differs from much of the literature on media audiences because it credits the audience with much more interpretative power - here, media products are viewed not as political propaganda, disturbing imagery, or texts encoded to produce certain readings, but instead as cultural material from which viewers and readers can construct identities.

## Chapter 3: Research Methods in Media Psychology

Today scientists are perhaps nore modest about the inferences they can draw from their results, and of the kind of psychological processes that are the most suitable for the experimental method.

Faces seen in close-up are responded to more intensely than those seen in smaller scale.

### Survey methods

If we are interested in studying everyday experiences of media we hve to resort to more contrived methods of data collection (which typically involve asking people what media they use) and devising indirect measures of its effects or influences. Typically, such research is done as part of a large project using a variety of methods, known as a survey. The survey was the principal tool of cultivation research, in which disillusionment had set in regarding the kinds of information gleaned through laboratory-based studies. The trend in audience research has moved towards correlational designs, in which researchers study associations, or reltionships, among a number or measured (dependent) variables instead of studying the effects of one variable on another.

The association between two variables is a useful starting point in an analysis, but bivariate analysis have a notorious habit of throwing up spurious relationships. To mitigate this, we need to weight the correlation betwen these two variables according to the correlations between both of these variables and another third variable. This is called __partialling out__ the effects of a third variable. This kind of partial correlational analysis provides the building blocks for a hugely influential statistical approach known as _multivariate analysis_. In recent years, psychologists and other social scientists have devised models of behavior on the basis of many different variables, all entered into the same equation. The goal of such analysis is to examine the extent to which variables predict one another, both individually and collectively. This way, __models__ are created by lumping together all the demographic variables, measurig their combined influence on all the media use variables, and portray this analysis by means of a path diagram.

The bedrock of the survey is the questionnaire, although the term "questionnaire" covers a vast range of different instruments. The choice of measure used depends entirely on the analysis you are intending to conduct. Focus groups are ofen used in an exploratory fashion, to generate ideas and materials for large-scale data collection using questionnaires and scales.

### Analysis of media texts

Content analysis is most frequently used in media research in order to investigate the nature of media representations. Typically, a researcher constructs a schedule based on the possible types of representation (e.g., ethnic groups on British television) and the different texts to be covered (e.g., different genres of television show). Usually, categories in content analysis are not determines until all the material has been coded.

Analysing data gathered through content analysis poses problems different from those encountered when analysing experimental or survey data, becase they normally come in the form of category counts ("nominal" data). The most basic type of analysis for this kind of data is the chi-square test, which can be conducted with only a few categories and data spread in a _contingency table_. There are sophisticated techniques for dealing with larger contingency tables, known as _log-linear analysis_. This works a little bit like the model approach to correlational data described in the section on survey research: you predict interactions between different factors and test these as a set of equations.

There is no need for content analysis to be quantitative; often, the data we have is not suited to statistical testing, because either we prefer not to assign the data to inflexible categories or the category boundaries are blurred. When this is the case, we may use qualitative content analysis in order to build up a taxonomy of materials, or to demostrate a process or theory that explains the data.

A different approach to textual analysis altogether is to perform qualitative analysis of verbal or vidual data. This is a useful approach if we are interested in the _meaning_ of texts rather than in simply counting the frequency of occurrence; figures alone do not possess any explanatory power, and for that we need some form of interpretative analysis, such as __discourse analysis__.

There are two broad traditions of discourse analysis, influenced by different concerns and theoretical orientations. The first tradition is primarily concerned with language use, which requires close attention to the linguistic features of texts; in media researh it has been used to study the structure of news stories, with particular emphasis on narrative style. The second strand hails from the critical social science tradition, and the emphasis is on the text as deeply embedded in a variety of social and discursive _practices_ that together constitute a version of reality. We might use this form of analysis to investigate the way that formal realism is produced in a television show. Discourse analysis has been criticised for its subjectivity and lack of formal procedure. In psychology, however, more formal procedures for conducting discourse analysis have been articulated, and there is a growing acceptance of this kind of research. Furthermore, discourse analysis feeds into related techniques such as rhetorical analysis, which has proved useful for studying the nature of advertising, and narrative analysis, which has been used to study both textual material and interview data.

## Chapter 4: The Effects of Media Violence

Imitation of violent behavior on television is likely to be influenced by the status of the aggressor. A common complaint is that media coverage of violence glamourises the behavior. There is some evidence that the attractiveness of, and degree of identification with, aggressive models enhances the effects of media violence. Nevertheless, the biggest effects have generally been found in the most artificial studies.

Two theories have been proposed to explain media effects of aggression: modelization and excitement transfer. Both have had serious criticisms levied at them. The biggest problem for excitation transfer theory, however, is the fat that violent media are not necessarily the most exciting stimuli to which viewers are exposed: erotic stimuli have been shown to not only produce higher physiological arousal than did the violent and control media, but also induced study subjects to be more aggressive. This finding clearly supports excitation transfer, but provides mixed evidnce for a media violence effect. In fact, studies that have used combinations of erotic and violent stimuli have produced the highest aggression measures of all.

- __Desensitisation__: an important issue related to excitation transfer, or any physiological theory of media violence, is the effect of repeated exposure to violent material over a long period of time. Short-term effects indiced in the laboratory are spectacular in themselves, but surely don't the effects wear off after sufficient time as habituation sets in? The result, it is argued, is desensitisation to violence, both on television and on real life. Research doesn't quite support this, as large-scale analyses of media violence have consistently noted strong effects for men, who are generally much heavier consumers of violent media.

### Characteristics of the users of violent media

Personality, or dispositional, variables have been increasingly built into media violence research designs. An important one is the level of aggression displayed by participants at the outset of a study; _trait aggresion_ is the biological tendency for an individual to display aggression. Results on this matter have been mixed, however.

It's actually been found that people with innate aggressive an antisocial tendencies consume _less_ media than normal people.

There's relatively little data collected on people's reasons for actively seking violent media in the first place. This question can't be answered without first taking a closer look at what actually constitutes "violent media", a major problem with the literature. One of the features of the media violence literature has been a tendency to ignore different genres of media to the effect that the category "violent media" can encompass incredible diverse material, both in genre classification and in picture quality and realism. The definition usually used for violent media is to broad to capture the type of media that is actively sought after for its violence: most films that receive certificates based on violent content are valued for other reasons, such as comic appeal or general artistic merit. In the purest sense, the term "violent media" refers to cultural material that has little to recommend it apart from its violent content - films that would be classified as "video nasties".

Two fundamental reasons why an individual (or group) might seek violent media: simple curiosity and the fact that violent media presents viewers with a challenge.

The attraction of "forbidden fruit" for teenage boys is aprt of a broader rite-of-passage that is part of the preparation for adulthood; seeing an adult-only movie has become one fo the targets of early adolescence. There's great importance in the group viewing context for the enjoyment of violent movies.

Empirical research offers little support for the __catharsis__ hyphotesis, but this may reflect the fact that media violence in the laboratory tends to be unexpected, and not actively selected by participants. Few studies have been properly designed to investigate the cathartic effect of media violence.

Little relation has also been found between people's enjoyment of media and the amount/degree of violence in said media. It's been suggested that a key element in the media violence debate is the _meaning_ of violence for viewers, which may differ sharply among individuals. This element has been largely neglected in the laboratory research.

### Cognitive factors in media violence

For cultivation researchers, the primary concern was not that violence would be imitated, but that the prevalence of violence in the media resulted in a climate of fear in the population at large. This "mean world" effect was demonstrated in studies that found that heavy viewers of television were likely to overestimate the amount of violent crime that took place in the real world.

Most public concern about media violence concerns the effects of films and entertainment in general. Cultivation theory forces us to look more broadly, particularly at the role that news bulletins and current affairs television play in perpetuating fear about crime. Memory for disturbing features of TV news tends to be more powerful than for other kinds of information, thereby making crime and violence more salient to the viewers. At an individual level, negative news bulletins have been found to intensify personal concerns, even when not directly related to the content of the programme. Concerns about the effect of television news have, however, tended to be downplayed in relation to the effect of entertainment. This result perhaps stems from the opinion that news programmes are faithful reflections of reality, and that it is simply a matter of public interest to be informed about real-life violence.

One way in which media violence might elecit aggressive behavior in viewers over long periods of time (a lifetime, perhaps) is through cognitive processing rather than crude behavioral responses. Cognitive effects of media can be grouped into two very broad categories: they may elicit obtrusive thoughts, or they may work at a more conscious level in that they stimulate ideas about how to behave. It is the latter mechanism that is thought to provide the basis for imitation of screen violence, rather than the learning-and-reinforcement process argued by behaviorists.

A more cognitive-assiciationist approach to media violence involves __priming__ as its key mechanism. According to this theory, implicit memories of violent scenes can be reactivated if appropiate cues are provided. When individuals are required to make decisions, the priming of violent stimuli may influence their choice. Another way in which media violence might prime subsequent behavior is by activating certain patterns of cognition or behavior that have become formulaic over time. The effects of media violence might well depend on the meaning that the violence has for the viewer.

The findings of research on the effects videogames play are even more inconclusive than in the media violence literature in general.

Three contexts need to be considered to understand media violence (Shaw, 2001):

- The _narrative_ itself has a powerful influence on viewers' responses; by setting up a storyline and creating characters, viewers are able to interpret the violence, and through the use of social scripts may even be able to anticipate it.
- The program or movie _genre_ may determine viewers' anticipation.
- Viewers' own experiences - both of viewing violent media and of real-life violence - will have a moderating effect for their interpretation of and reaction to a violent incident on screen.

Media effects research has been using inappropiate stimuli for a long time. Might be interesting to ask the _creators_ of the violent material how do they think it works, and why they put it all together the way they do.

## Prosocial Effects of Media

Tales of prosocial effects of media suggest ways of communicating socially useful material without dressing it up as education.

Much of the psychological literature on media is somewhat _reactive_; there are many studies of the effects of violent media, but relatively few examining the effects of other kinds of media, even though they should ostensibly share certain characteristics.

At low levels, perceptual and cognitive responses to televisual stimuli should hold true whatever the programme content; at higher levels, processes such as identification and parasocial interaction with media figures, or comprehension of story lines and the "reading" of generic and formulaic media styles, should shape understandings and responses to all televised material.

An important difference between the antisocial and prosocial effects of media is that the former are almost invariably accidental. Probably no media producer has ever deliberately set out to produce antisocial effects, but they frequently set out to create material that will have positive long-term benefits on consumers, whether it be a soap opera storyline that informs viewers about health issues, or an educational programme for children.

### The "effects" research tradition

What is "prosocial behavior"? Whereas studies of media and antisocial behavior have concentrated on aggression and violence, studies of prosocial and behavior have been more diverse. The most heavily researched behavior is _altruism_, or helping, frequently studied using experimental methods. Less easily researched behaviors include _sharing_ and _empathy_.

Studies of viewer empathy have produced a mixture of findings. On of them (Zillman & Bryant, 1975) suggests that empathy is strongly determined by character judgements, usually involving some degree of moral evaluation. Increasingly, the relatives of victims of murder and other unlawful deaths ar invited to give press conferences, because the police are well aware of the emphatic impact of television, and the resultant increased likelihood of members of the public coming forward with useful information.

Thus far, the effects for prosocial effects of media is mixed. One problem is that, as with violent content, prosocial content is usually embedded deep within the narrative context of a dramatic prodution, so we can't quite classify a program as "prosocial".

### The effects of "prosocial media"

_Sesame street_ has been the focus of most of the research into educational media, as it was designed with prosocial aims in mind. Rice, Houston, Truglio and Wright (1990) found that Sesame Street viewing was a good predictor of vocabulary knowledge at ages 3 and 5, but older children did not get this benefit; those still watching at ages 6 and 7 were more likely to be slow learners. The authors explained this in terms of __quick incidental learning__, which is more effective with 3-year-olds than 5-year-olds. It was also found that the group of children who benefited the most from wtching the show were those with higher socioeconomic status, which might be explained by the finding that _parental mediation_ (discussion between parents and children about the show's contents) enhances the effect of viewing.

The belief that watching television is passive activity from which it's impossible for children to elarn anything has prevented greater use of television as an educational medium, but it's clear que a los of verbal and gestural material in children has its roots in audiovisual content.

Whether or not media produce the psychological effects claimed by many social scientists, there is no doubt that they are invaluable menas of communicating information, whether it is promoting desirable behavior, communicating health messages, etc. How effectve those campaings are depends on the type of information being communicated. In a couple of studies that backfired (in that they _decreased_ self-efficacy related to the desired behavior among the group they were targeting), it's been suggested that the use of negative health messaged backfired: rather than shaming the public into changing their behavior, it inadvertedly provided them with a readly available set of excused for _not_ changing their behavior.

This study raises a commin problem with using psychology for health communication and other public service announcements: media material is often devised by educated, middle-class people whose idea of a persuasive message may not ring true with the public at large. Of course, there are instancs in which health communication in the media has been at odds with other media representations of health behavior; smoking is possibly the best example of a true media effect.

In many parts of the world, information about social issues is embedded within popular drama. Prosocial soaps follow the sam broad structure as do soaps in Europe and North America, except that the storylines are explicitly prosocial; even in the West soaps often feature storylines that are intended to educate as much as entertain. There is always some doubt about the effectiveness of such shows, as long-standing attitudes may be resistant to change. Getting the message may require viewers to do a critical reading of the media text, and audiences are often not as sophisticated as producers assume they are. Media psychologists need to study the meanings that media hold for audiences, rather than assuming that their effects are homogenous. Nevertheless, the findings from global soap operas indicate that, when positive social messages are embedded in narrative texts, they can have a substantial impact, even if only on public awareness of important issues.

### Parental mediation

Parental mediation is, at its simplest, the idea of a parent as a coviewer of content with the child. Rather than leaving the child "vulnerable" to the unmediated influence of undesired material, when the adult views television with the child there is an opportunity to discuss and explain some of the more disturbing material, and to consolidate the prosocial or educational content. Despite the fears, children are much mure likely to view adult material when coviewing with an adult; in other words, it is the adults who make the decisions about viewing material. However, it might be that coviewing tends to be incidental.

The view of many parents is that the only way to prevent children from watching undesirable media is to simply prohibit viewing. An study found that, in their sample, restricted viewers generally saw less of everything - rather than controlling the _quality_ of television their children watch, restrictive parents simply control the _quantity_. There are several problems with blanket restrictions on viewing: policing exposire to undesirable media is virtually impossible, and the "forbidden fruit" effect may be stronger for children whose media use is subject to such censure. Given the easy access to media children have today, the need for parents and children to share viewing experiences assumes greater importance than in the past. Simple coviewing isn't the answer: effective mediation requires parents to discuss the programme content with the child, perhaps explain ambiguous or disturbing material, or follow up on concepts from the viewing session.

Not only has parental mediation been found to enhance the learning effect, it's also possible to blunt the negative effects of television by discussing the relevant issues. When using mediators of either gender, certain types of content can effect huge decreases in school children's stereotypical attitudes, whereas watching alone actually produced a small increase. With older children (11 or 12), mediation still had a powerful effect, but there was also a decrease when viewing alone, suggesting that by this age children are able to process the prosocial message without adult help. It has been suggested that children as young as 7 are able to understand quite complex moral messages contained in sitcom storylines).

There might be both different styles of mediation for different material, as well as differences between the mediators themselves. A study using telephone survey identified four mediation styles:

- _Nonmediators_, who might coview with children but never discuss content.
- _Optimists_, whose mediation consists of mostly positive comments about the content, and who tend to be generally trusting of television.
- _Pessimists_, who make generally negative or sceptical comments to their children, and tend to be generally distrustful of television.
- _Selectives_, which have a more or less equal balance of negative and positive contributions.

Simple coviewing and prohibitive viewing are largely ineffective means of modifying children's interpretation of television. The nature of parent-child discussions about television are therefore likely to rely heavily on parental attitudes toward the media, and on existing communication patterns within families and on general parental style.

### Conclusion

Identifying and isolating prosocial content in standard media is much harder than coding acts of violence and aggression - not because it isn't there, but because it has to be understood and interpreted in its narrative context. Slowly, media violence researchers are appreciating that the same is true of violent content.

The mixed success in communicating prosocial media messages - attempting to change negative aspects of health behavior, or unacceptable attitudes - highlights the variety of "readings" that are open to media users, and indicates the need for more carefully targeted campaigns. Multiple readings exist for all forms of media message, not only the prosocial ones.
