## Chapter 1: What Is Media Psychology?

The emergence of the Internet and other interactive media networks have forced us to reconsider our concept of mass media as a medium where communication is ostensibly unidirectional. This is only to be expected, because each medium shapes society by its own terms, so we can never have a universal definition of "media" - the concept is forever in a state of flux.

Media are effectively ciphers, empty of meaning, until we perceive some form of content, which is then treated as a message.

Every decade in the last 50 years has seen major devlopments in mass communications and media. Keeping a finger on the pulse of change is difficult when you are trying to discover universal truths about human nature. [...] The research has been conducted in response to calls for scientific evidence for the harmful influence of media, rather than an intellectual need to understand how media in general might influence behavior. As a result, studies have been devised that have the best chance of securing a statistically significant outcome for a causal relationship between violent media and aggressive behavior. Despite widespread agreement as to the shortcomings of muh experimental research on media violence, its legacy has been bequeathed to the media themselves, and to politicians, who continue to make unsubstantiated statements about the direct relationship between media violence and antisocial behavior.

## Chapter 2: Theoretical Issues in Media Research

The "media effects" tradition of research has probably had the greatest impact of all media research on public life in the last 50 years. Concerns about the negative psychological effects of media are so commonplace that they are barely questioned outside academia. [...] Behaviorism is at its most persuasive when children are concerned, and so it's not surprising that the most popular behaviorist media research was that carried out by Bandura, who found that children who had been exposed to violence, either live or recorded, performed significantly more aggressive acts. There are, however, many problems with these findings.

After behaviorism, the task facing psychology involved an attempt to open the "black box" postulated by behaviorists in place of the mind, or brain. Effects research subsequently developed along two separate paths: the physiological perspective and the cognitive perspective. Other researches working in the same tradition attempted to integrate these approaches, such as the theory of "excitation transfer", building on top of the two-factor model of emotion.

In many areas of media studies, the "effects" tradition has acquired a bad name, bracketed with psychology in general, being charged with "individualizing" media concerns and ignoring wider social and cultural contexts. [...] The term "influences" is more appropiate, because it implies a complex interplay of social and environmental factors on behaviorof which media is one part, whereas the term effects suggests, perhaps erroneously, that the causal relationship between media and human behavior can be studied in isolation.

_Cultivation theory_: a more global approach to media effects that regards media as a key element in cultural socialization as a whole, looking at the way in which individuals grow up in a society in which media help shape our understanding of the world.

### Uses and gratifications research

Uses and gratifications research (U&G) approaches individual differences instead, and its research draws on traditional psychological theory, but from the Maslow school of humanism rather than from behaviorism. In this approach, the viewer (or general media user) is in control, and rather than studying the person as a passive recipient of effects, U&G researches look at the _motives_  for using media and the _needs_ that media use gratifies. U&G research, above all else, studies how and why people use media in general. (pag. 23)

Papachrissi and Rubin (2000) examined the factors that were most likely to predict people's use of the Internet. They identified five motives:

- Interpersonal utility (online social interaction)
- A way of passing time
- Information seeking
- Convenience
- Entertainment

Some Internet users use the medium as a functional alternative to social interaction, particularly those who had difficulties in making friends and forming relationships in face-to-face communication.

Three key ways in which individuals develop "dependency relations" with media (the dependency theory of DeFleur and Ball-Rockeach, 1989):

- Media provides information that enables us to _understand_ the world, which at the level of "self-understanding" provides us with information about ourselves - it enables the creation of identities by allowing us to interpret our behavior and compare ourselves to others.
- We may depend on media for _orientation_, either in terms of action (deciding to go on a diet, or voting in an election) or interaction (how to deal with social situations).
- Media provides us with opportunities to _play_ (either for solitary relaxation, or social activity like visiting the cinema).

### The "active audience"

Rather than treating the media user as an isolated television viewer locked into dependency relationships with media, __audience theory__ sees media users as social groups that are strongly influenced by media, but - like U&G subjects - far from passive. Much audience reseach has focused on the cultural _meanings_ that user derive from media.

One ofbejctive of this school of thought was to replace the two-step flow concept of communication (sender-message-receiver) as the dominant model of media research with a _circuit_, in which information is encoded (e.g. using television production codes) and then decoded by the audience. The idea behind this model was that concepts such as two-step flow and the "hypodermic needle" theory of media effects treat messages as fixed by the sender, and reception processes as determined by the message content. Hall (1980) suggested that there are three ways in which audiences could "decode" media messages:

1. The _dominant_ code, by which viewers select the "preferred reading" intended by the producers.
2. The _negotiated_ code, by which audiences modify the message, perhaps on the basis of personal experience.
3. The _oppositional_ code, by which the message is treted with deep suspicion, as biased estabilishment propaganda.

Research (Morley, 1980) has suggested that the social and cultural characteristics of the audience partly dictate which form of encoding they will use.

Some authors have asserted that the circuit model can perhaps be applied to news and current affairs media (because it was designed with this sort of material in mind), but offers inappropiate explanations for audience response to popular cultural material, such as soap opera and pop music.

Some of the most exciting research in the active audience tradition is Henry Jenkins' work on fandom, which differs from much of the literature on media audiences because it credits the audience with much more interpretative power - here, media products are viewed not as political propaganda, disturbing imagery, or texts encoded to produce certain readings, but instead as cultural material from which viewers and readers can construct identities.

## Chapter 3: Research Methods in Media Psychology

Today scientists are perhaps nore modest about the inferences they can draw from their results, and of the kind of psychological processes that are the most suitable for the experimental method.

Faces seen in close-up are responded to more intensely than those seen in smaller scale.

### Survey methods

If we are interested in studying everyday experiences of media we hve to resort to more contrived methods of data collection (which typically involve asking people what media they use) and devising indirect measures of its effects or influences. Typically, such research is done as part of a large project using a variety of methods, known as a survey. The survey was the principal tool of cultivation research, in which disillusionment had set in regarding the kinds of information gleaned through laboratory-based studies. The trend in audience research has moved towards correlational designs, in which researchers study associations, or reltionships, among a number or measured (dependent) variables instead of studying the effects of one variable on another.

The association between two variables is a useful starting point in an analysis, but bivariate analysis have a notorious habit of throwing up spurious relationships. To mitigate this, we need to weight the correlation betwen these two variables according to the correlations between both of these variables and another third variable. This is called __partialling out__ the effects of a third variable. This kind of partial correlational analysis provides the building blocks for a hugely influential statistical approach known as _multivariate analysis_. In recent years, psychologists and other social scientists have devised models of behavior on the basis of many different variables, all entered into the same equation. The goal of such analysis is to examine the extent to which variables predict one another, both individually and collectively. This way, __models__ are created by lumping together all the demographic variables, measurig their combined influence on all the media use variables, and portray this analysis by means of a path diagram.

The bedrock of the survey is the questionnaire, although the term "questionnaire" covers a vast range of different instruments. The choice of measure used depends entirely on the analysis you are intending to conduct. Focus groups are ofen used in an exploratory fashion, to generate ideas and materials for large-scale data collection using questionnaires and scales.

### Analysis of media texts

Content analysis is most frequently used in media research in order to investigate the nature of media representations. Typically, a researcher constructs a schedule based on the possible types of representation (e.g., ethnic groups on British television) and the different texts to be covered (e.g., different genres of television show). Usually, categories in content analysis are not determines until all the material has been coded.

Analysing data gathered through content analysis poses problems different from those encountered when analysing experimental or survey data, becase they normally come in the form of category counts ("nominal" data). The most basic type of analysis for this kind of data is the chi-square test, which can be conducted with only a few categories and data spread in a _contingency table_. There are sophisticated techniques for dealing with larger contingency tables, known as _log-linear analysis_. This works a little bit like the model approach to correlational data described in the section on survey research: you predict interactions between different factors and test these as a set of equations.

There is no need for content analysis to be quantitative; often, the data we have is not suited to statistical testing, because either we prefer not to assign the data to inflexible categories or the category boundaries are blurred. When this is the case, we may use qualitative content analysis in order to build up a taxonomy of materials, or to demostrate a process or theory that explains the data.

A different approach to textual analysis altogether is to perform qualitative analysis of verbal or vidual data. This is a useful approach if we are interested in the _meaning_ of texts rather than in simply counting the frequency of occurrence; figures alone do not possess any explanatory power, and for that we need some form of interpretative analysis, such as __discourse analysis__.

There are two broad traditions of discourse analysis, influenced by different concerns and theoretical orientations. The first tradition is primarily concerned with language use, which requires close attention to the linguistic features of texts; in media researh it has been used to study the structure of news stories, with particular emphasis on narrative style. The second strand hails from the critical social science tradition, and the emphasis is on the text as deeply embedded in a variety of social and discursive _practices_ that together constitute a version of reality. We might use this form of analysis to investigate the way that formal realism is produced in a television show. Discourse analysis has been criticised for its subjectivity and lack of formal procedure. In psychology, however, more formal procedures for conducting discourse analysis have been articulated, and there is a growing acceptance of this kind of research. Furthermore, discourse analysis feeds into related techniques such as rhetorical analysis, which has proved useful for studying the nature of advertising, and narrative analysis, which has been used to study both textual material and interview data.

## Chapter 4: The Effects of Media Violence

Imitation of violent behavior on television is likely to be influenced by the status of the aggressor. A common complaint is that media coverage of violence glamourises the behavior. There is some evidence that the attractiveness of, and degree of identification with, aggressive models enhances the effects of media violence. Nevertheless, the biggest effects have generally been found in the most artificial studies.

Two theories have been proposed to explain media effects of aggression: modelization and excitement transfer. Both have had serious criticisms levied at them. The biggest problem for excitation transfer theory, however, is the fat that violent media are not necessarily the most exciting stimuli to which viewers are exposed: erotic stimuli have been shown to not only produce higher physiological arousal than did the violent and control media, but also induced study subjects to be more aggressive. This finding clearly supports excitation transfer, but provides mixed evidnce for a media violence effect. In fact, studies that have used combinations of erotic and violent stimuli have produced the highest aggression measures of all.

- __Desensitisation__: an important issue related to excitation transfer, or any physiological theory of media violence, is the effect of repeated exposure to violent material over a long period of time. Short-term effects indiced in the laboratory are spectacular in themselves, but surely don't the effects wear off after sufficient time as habituation sets in? The result, it is argued, is desensitisation to violence, both on television and on real life. Research doesn't quite support this, as large-scale analyses of media violence have consistently noted strong effects for men, who are generally much heavier consumers of violent media.

### Characteristics of the users of violent media

Personality, or dispositional, variables have been increasingly built into media violence research designs. An important one is the level of aggression displayed by participants at the outset of a study; _trait aggresion_ is the biological tendency for an individual to display aggression. Results on this matter have been mixed, however.

It's actually been found that people with innate aggressive an antisocial tendencies consume _less_ media than normal people.

There's relatively little data collected on people's reasons for actively seking violent media in the first place. This question can't be answered without first taking a closer look at what actually constitutes "violent media", a major problem with the literature. One of the features of the media violence literature has been a tendency to ignore different genres of media to the effect that the category "violent media" can encompass incredible diverse material, both in genre classification and in picture quality and realism. The definition usually used for violent media is to broad to capture the type of media that is actively sought after for its violence: most films that receive certificates based on violent content are valued for other reasons, such as comic appeal or general artistic merit. In the purest sense, the term "violent media" refers to cultural material that has little to recommend it apart from its violent content - films that would be classified as "video nasties".

Two fundamental reasons why an individual (or group) might seek violent media: simple curiosity and the fact that violent media presents viewers with a challenge.

The attraction of "forbidden fruit" for teenage boys is aprt of a broader rite-of-passage that is part of the preparation for adulthood; seeing an adult-only movie has become one fo the targets of early adolescence. There's great importance in the group viewing context for the enjoyment of violent movies.

Empirical research offers little support for the __catharsis__ hyphotesis, but this may reflect the fact that media violence in the laboratory tends to be unexpected, and not actively selected by participants. Few studies have been properly designed to investigate the cathartic effect of media violence.

Little relation has also been found between people's enjoyment of media and the amount/degree of violence in said media. It's been suggested that a key element in the media violence debate is the _meaning_ of violence for viewers, which may differ sharply among individuals. This element has been largely neglected in the laboratory research.

### Cognitive factors in media violence

For cultivation researchers, the primary concern was not that violence would be imitated, but that the prevalence of violence in the media resulted in a climate of fear in the population at large. This "mean world" effect was demonstrated in studies that found that heavy viewers of television were likely to overestimate the amount of violent crime that took place in the real world.

Most public concern about media violence concerns the effects of films and entertainment in general. Cultivation theory forces us to look more broadly, particularly at the role that news bulletins and current affairs television play in perpetuating fear about crime. Memory for disturbing features of TV news tends to be more powerful than for other kinds of information, thereby making crime and violence more salient to the viewers. At an individual level, negative news bulletins have been found to intensify personal concerns, even when not directly related to the content of the programme. Concerns about the effect of television news have, however, tended to be downplayed in relation to the effect of entertainment. This result perhaps stems from the opinion that news programmes are faithful reflections of reality, and that it is simply a matter of public interest to be informed about real-life violence.

One way in which media violence might elecit aggressive behavior in viewers over long periods of time (a lifetime, perhaps) is through cognitive processing rather than crude behavioral responses. Cognitive effects of media can be grouped into two very broad categories: they may elicit obtrusive thoughts, or they may work at a more conscious level in that they stimulate ideas about how to behave. It is the latter mechanism that is thought to provide the basis for imitation of screen violence, rather than the learning-and-reinforcement process argued by behaviorists.

A more cognitive-assiciationist approach to media violence involves __priming__ as its key mechanism. According to this theory, implicit memories of violent scenes can be reactivated if appropiate cues are provided. When individuals are required to make decisions, the priming of violent stimuli may influence their choice. Another way in which media violence might prime subsequent behavior is by activating certain patterns of cognition or behavior that have become formulaic over time. The effects of media violence might well depend on the meaning that the violence has for the viewer.

The findings of research on the effects videogames play are even more inconclusive than in the media violence literature in general.

Three contexts need to be considered to understand media violence (Shaw, 2001):

- The _narrative_ itself has a powerful influence on viewers' responses; by setting up a storyline and creating characters, viewers are able to interpret the violence, and through the use of social scripts may even be able to anticipate it.
- The program or movie _genre_ may determine viewers' anticipation.
- Viewers' own experiences - both of viewing violent media and of real-life violence - will have a moderating effect for their interpretation of and reaction to a violent incident on screen.

Media effects research has been using inappropiate stimuli for a long time. Might be interesting to ask the _creators_ of the violent material how do they think it works, and why they put it all together the way they do.

## Prosocial Effects of Media

Tales of prosocial effects of media suggest ways of communicating socially useful material without dressing it up as education.

Much of the psychological literature on media is somewhat _reactive_; there are many studies of the effects of violent media, but relatively few examining the effects of other kinds of media, even though they should ostensibly share certain characteristics.

At low levels, perceptual and cognitive responses to televisual stimuli should hold true whatever the programme content; at higher levels, processes such as identification and parasocial interaction with media figures, or comprehension of story lines and the "reading" of generic and formulaic media styles, should shape understandings and responses to all televised material.

An important difference between the antisocial and prosocial effects of media is that the former are almost invariably accidental. Probably no media producer has ever deliberately set out to produce antisocial effects, but they frequently set out to create material that will have positive long-term benefits on consumers, whether it be a soap opera storyline that informs viewers about health issues, or an educational programme for children.

### The "effects" research tradition

What is "prosocial behavior"? Whereas studies of media and antisocial behavior have concentrated on aggression and violence, studies of prosocial and behavior have been more diverse. The most heavily researched behavior is _altruism_, or helping, frequently studied using experimental methods. Less easily researched behaviors include _sharing_ and _empathy_.

Studies of viewer empathy have produced a mixture of findings. One of them (Zillman & Bryant, 1975) suggests that empathy is strongly determined by character judgements, usually involving some degree of moral evaluation. Increasingly, the relatives of victims of murder and other unlawful deaths ar invited to give press conferences, because the police are well aware of the emphatic impact of television, and the resultant increased likelihood of members of the public coming forward with useful information.

Thus far, the effects for prosocial effects of media is mixed. One problem is that, as with violent content, prosocial content is usually embedded deep within the narrative context of a dramatic prodution, so we can't quite classify a program as "prosocial".

### The effects of "prosocial media"

_Sesame Street_ has been the focus of most of the research into educational media, as it was designed with prosocial aims in mind. Rice, Houston, Truglio and Wright (1990) found that Sesame Street viewing was a good predictor of vocabulary knowledge at ages 3 and 5, but older children did not get this benefit; those still watching at ages 6 and 7 were more likely to be slow learners. The authors explained this in terms of __quick incidental learning__, which is more effective with 3-year-olds than 5-year-olds. It was also found that the group of children who benefited the most from watching the show were those with higher socioeconomic status, which might be explained by the finding that _parental mediation_ (discussion between parents and children about the show's contents) enhances the effect of viewing.

The belief that watching television is passive activity from which it's impossible for children to learn anything has prevented greater use of television as an educational medium, but it's clear que a lots of verbal and gestural material in children has its roots in audiovisual content.

Whether or not media produce the psychological effects claimed by many social scientists, there is no doubt that they are invaluable means of communicating information, whether it is promoting desirable behavior, communicating health messages, etc. How effectve those campaings are depends on the type of information being communicated. In a couple of studies that backfired (in that they _decreased_ self-efficacy related to the desired behavior among the group they were targeting), it's been suggested that the use of negative health messaged backfired: rather than shaming the public into changing their behavior, it inadvertedly provided them with a readily available set of excuses for _not_ changing their behavior.

This study raises a common problem with using psychology for health communication and other public service announcements: media material is often devised by educated, middle-class people whose idea of a persuasive message may not ring true with the public at large. Of course, there are instances in which health communication in the media has been at odds with other media representations of health behavior; smoking is possibly the best example of a true media effect.

In many parts of the world, information about social issues is embedded within popular drama. Prosocial soaps follow the same broad structure as do soaps in Europe and North America, except that the storylines are explicitly prosocial; even in the West soaps often feature storylines that are intended to educate as much as entertain. There is always some doubt about the effectiveness of such shows, as long-standing attitudes may be resistant to change. Getting the message may require viewers to do a critical reading of the media text, and audiences are often not as sophisticated as producers assume they are. Media psychologists need to study the meanings that media hold for audiences, rather than assuming that their effects are homogenous. Nevertheless, the findings from global soap operas indicate that, when positive social messages are embedded in narrative texts, they can have a substantial impact, even if only on public awareness of important issues.

### Parental mediation

Parental mediation is, at its simplest, the idea of a parent as a coviewer of content with the child. Rather than leaving the child "vulnerable" to the unmediated influence of undesired material, when the adult views television with the child there is an opportunity to discuss and explain some of the more disturbing material, and to consolidate the prosocial or educational content. Despite the fears, children are much more likely to view adult material when coviewing with an adult; in other words, it is the adults who make the decisions about viewing material. However, it might be that coviewing tends to be incidental.

The view of many parents is that the only way to prevent children from watching undesirable media is to simply prohibit viewing. An study found that, in their sample, restricted viewers generally saw less of everything - rather than controlling the _quality_ of television their children watch, restrictive parents simply control the _quantity_. There are several problems with blanket restrictions on viewing: policing exposire to undesirable media is virtually impossible, and the "forbidden fruit" effect may be stronger for children whose media use is subject to such censure. Given the easy access to media children have today, the need for parents and children to share viewing experiences assumes greater importance than in the past. Simple coviewing isn't the answer: effective mediation requires parents to discuss the programme content with the child, perhaps explain ambiguous or disturbing material, or follow up on concepts from the viewing session.

Not only has parental mediation been found to enhance the learning effect, it's also possible to blunt the negative effects of television by discussing the relevant issues. When using mediators of either gender, certain types of content can effect huge decreases in school children's stereotypical attitudes, whereas watching alone actually produced a small increase. With older children (11 or 12), mediation still had a powerful effect, but there was also a decrease when viewing alone, suggesting that by this age children are able to process the prosocial message without adult help. It has been suggested that children as young as 7 are able to understand quite complex moral messages contained in sitcom storylines.

There might be both different styles of mediation for different material, as well as differences between the mediators themselves. A study using telephone survey identified four mediation styles:

- _Nonmediators_, who might coview with children but never discuss content.
- _Optimists_, whose mediation consists of mostly positive comments about the content, and who tend to be generally trusting of television.
- _Pessimists_, who make generally negative or sceptical comments to their children, and tend to be generally distrustful of television.
- _Selectives_, which have a more or less equal balance of negative and positive contributions.

Simple coviewing and prohibitive viewing are largely ineffective means of modifying children's interpretation of television. The nature of parent-child discussions about television are therefore likely to rely heavily on parental attitudes toward the media, and on existing communication patterns within families and on general parental style.

### Conclusion

Identifying and isolating prosocial content in standard media is much harder than coding acts of violence and aggression - not because it isn't there, but because it has to be understood and interpreted in its narrative context. Slowly, media violence researchers are appreciating that the same is true of violent content.

The mixed success in communicating prosocial media messages - attempting to change negative aspects of health behavior, or unacceptable attitudes - highlights the variety of "readings" that are open to media users, and indicates the need for more carefully targeted campaigns. Multiple readings exist for all forms of media message, not only the prosocial ones.

## Chapter 7: Advertising

For advertisers, the ability to manipulate consumer impressions and decision-making has been the key to success. If product sales increase following a carefully orchestrated campaign, the persuasive tactics have evidently worked, although as with any natural experiment it is hard to estabilish cause and effect due to the lack of control over confounding variables.

For media users, advertising will undoubtedly have an effect on their lives in the same way as other media, but we try desperately to avoid being influenced, or to deny it, perhaps through the "third-person effect" (individuals perceive that media messages have more effect on other people than on themselves). This is because advertising, unlike other media, is founded on a theory of media effects. It exists __only__ to dupe and persuade, and if it fails to dupe and persuade, it fails completely. Increasingly, the secret of successful advertising has been the extent to which the advertiser can disguise the ad, or at least disguise the elements of the ad that achieve the intended psychological effect. This is testimony to our stubbornness as media consumers not to be influenced by information that we perceive as vulgar, low culture, and over which we have no control.

### Cognitive and behavioral effects of advertising

Academic research into the effects of advertising tends to fall into two groups of effects produced by ads: _perceptual_ effects, such as low camera angles to make the speaker seem authoritative (a tactic now abandoned by political advertisers); and _attitudinal_ effects, which examine the short- and long-term impact of an ad on the consumer's impression of the brand and product. More generally, research has focused on the effectiveness of ads in shaping consumer behavior. Most research on advertising rarely queries the cumulative effects of continuously viewing ads on human behavior.

#### Perceptual effects

Most of the research on perceptual effects of advertising have drawn on the information-processing approach of the 1950s that tended to view memory and attention as discrete cognitive processes. While it has been argued that attention is the key issue for television advertising, the nature of attention is complex, and there are more subtle factors mediating between attentional processes and the effectiveness of advertising.

The idea that advertising may work at a level below full consciousness has long been a feature of mainstream psychology itself. Most psychology graduates will have encountered the concept of _subliminal advertising_, perhaps in relation to the study of iconic memory. _Iconic memory_ is the term given to the storage of a fleeting visual stimulus, typically a grid of 9 letters present on a screen for a brief period (50 ms or so). Experimental research has suggested that our retention of such displays is better than we realize.

These findings would seem to support the belief, still widely held in the business world, that advertising messages can be injected into the memory through exposing audiences to brief snatches of persuasive text. There is, however, no real evidence of this working; despite that, the concept of subliminal advertising has stuck within modern culture (though if we consider product placement as subliminal advertising, the success rate is somewhat higher). There is, though, evidence that subliminal-type effects may occur with material that is not directly perceived by viewers. Results suggest that, if subliminal advertising is capable of influencing consumer behavior, it is probably through the process of cognitive _priming_.

It seems certain that some of the success of advertising must be atributed to unconscious processing. We can do little about our memory for advertising jingles and slogans, which is usually a function of simple exposure. If we hear a jingle enough times on television or radio it will inevitably seep into our unconscious through the reactivation of neuronal firing patterns.

Our exposure to ads is rarely governed by conscious, deliberate attention. Television and cinema advertising have been hugely successful because the ads have a captive audience, particularly in the cinema. The increasing sophistication of television advertising over the years reflects the need to compete with programming for entertainment value. Research in this area suggests that programme genre has a strong effect on cognitive processing of commercials. Both violent and humorous programmes have been linked with low recall of advertising material. In both cases it seems that emotional response blunts the degree of attention that viewers can pay to advertising.

The latest challenge for advertisers is how to maximize the effectiveness of advertising over the internet. Businesses continue to shell out for internet advertising because it's relatively cheap and can allow the provision of detailed product information. From a cognitive perspective, internet advertising is never likely to be as effective as cinema and television advertising because of the user control over the medium. Interactive advertising (in which the user can dismiss the ad at the click of a button) cannot use many of the persuasive tactics of traditional advertising - ads interrupt shows or films and have time to develop storylines and characters, or they sit on a page, slowly sinking into the subconscious while the reader peruses the story alongside.

#### Attitudinal effects

Theories of subliminal advertising work on the assumption that attention and perception are sufficient motivation for consumers to buy products, as though shopping is an activity conducted by solitary individuals in a state of trance. Most consumer decisions, however, are made on a largely rational basis, and many take place in a social context. In the history of advertising, advertisers soon felt the need to look beyond perception and memory and toward socially oriented behavior, particularly the study of consumer attitudes.

Increasingly, the "effectiveness" of an ad is measured by whether consumers _like_ the product on offer and the advertisement itself, rather than whether the ad has actually inspired them to purchase the product. Instead of studying perceptual effects of ads, there has been increased interest in their emotional appeals, and the use of music and humour as effective devices.

One of the most heavily researched areas in the psychology of persuasion concerns the degree of _personal involvement_ with the issue or product concerned. Petty and Cacciopo (1981) developed this idea in their Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion, in which they argued that if consumers are highly involved with a product (such as if it means a lot to them), they will devote more thought ("elaboration") to the message contained in the advertisement.

The focus on the role of advertising in self-concept and identity construction has shifted the emphasis in advertising away from product-oriented ads toward consumer-oriented ads, with a corresponding shift from perceptual features of ads toward discursive and narrative features (sometimes characterised as the distinction between "hard sell" and "soft sell"). They found that the hard sell and soft sell approaches had different effects on different people. Consumers who scored highly on a test of "self-monitoring" - in other words, those who are socially more self-conscious, and likely to adapt their behavior according to their behavior according to the situation - had more favorable attitudes toward soft-sell ads. This happens, the authors maintained, because such consumers are more image conscious and thus respond better to advertising eliciting moods and associations rather than to hard-sell advertising with more factual information about a product. Low self-monitors, on the other hand, prefer hard-sell ads that describe the benefits of the product; such consumers take a more pragmatic approach to life, and are less concerned with image.

When we compare real social groups in their demographic characteristics, we find equally important differences in response to advertising. For some time, businesses have based their marketing strategies around consumer profiles - it's standard practice to select the target audience on the basis of demogrphic characteristics before deciding what sort of ad to commission. In advertising, such profiling is known as _psychographics_ - a picture is built up of the typical consumer, and the ad is designed to appeal to their assumed personality characteristics.

All kinds of assumptions are poured into advertising; advertising is less about how people are acting than about how they are dreaming: it reflects the _aspirations_ of the consumer rather than their current situation. This is sometimes expressed as the difference between one's current sense of self and an "ideal self". The opposite, using a representation of a _negative_ future self, is an equally powerful persuasive tactic.

Appealing to consumers' sense of self requires a good deal of speculation, perhaps drawing on psychodynamic theories of selfhood and fantasy, but there is evidence to suggest that the role of consumer goods in modern life is more central to our psychological life than is sometimes assumed in psychology. Some items have incredible salience for the way we construct our identity - and, perhaps, our psychological well-being (Cook, 1992).

Like cognitive/perceptual approaches to advertising, attitudinal studies of advertising can only speculate about their effectiveness. All the measures taken are indirectly related to _actual_ consumer behavior, and even the sales response to a specific advertising campaign tells us little about the behavior of the individual consumer.

### Rhetorical effects of advertising

A third approach to research on the effects of advertising is to ignore the consumer altogether and focus on the way advertising is created, particularly the use of rhetoric. While this research has been regarded as non-psychological, it's necessary to understand the materials before we can examine their effects.

Much of the research on advertising rhetoric has restricted itself to the analysis of verbal appeals to consumer. However, ads differ tremendously in the amount of verbal information they contain. Increasingly, advertisers work in a visual domain, so studies of rhetoric have had to examine the manipulation of nonverbal info. This is harder to determine, because visual rhetoric is more reliant on analysts' interpretative skills.

In the 60s, Durand identified four types of rhetorical figure that might be present in an ad: figures of addition, suppression, substitution and exchange.

#### Intertextuality and brand awareness

An advertisement is not a single, independent event; it's a text woven into the cultural fabric, cueing memories of other advertising and product characteristics. Brand awareness is built up through years of viewing and interpretation, and advertising goes beyond the mass media, into our homes and immediate environments. The message contained in a specific ad is therefore hard to isolate from the everyday experiences of the consumer.

Links between advertising can be seen as a form of _intertextuality_. This has the effect of stretching the meaning of an ad into other textual forms, so campaigns can build up meaning through different media. Some ads are extremely hard to decode, but it's been argued that's the point; advertisers actually see the intellectual effort involved in interpreting complex advertising as a selling point. Some ads are remembered specifically _because_ of their lack of information; linking them up with the subsequent television commercials, in one case, requieres extra cognitive work that eventually pays off in terms of recall and recognition.

Other form of intertextual advertising is _product placement_. Thusly, a star becomes a celebrity endorser, and at the same time, the visibility of contemporary consumer goods enhances the realism of the movie. In one study, it was found that the placement had little effect other than reinforcing existing behavior patterns and attitutes. Once again, it seems unlikely that exposure to one single instance of a product will have much impact on long-term behavior.

### Advertising and children

The practice of advertising to children has been hotly debated by psychologists, media and communication experts. Critics of advertising to children argue that children have not developed the cognitive sophistication that enables them to tell advertising apart from other forms of programming, and that even children as old as 12 may misunderstand the nature and function of advertising. Others maintain that children are more sophisticated than cognitive psychologists sometimes think, and that a ban on television commercials is unlikely to have much effect against other forces promoting relentless consumption in contemporary society.

Valkenburg and Cantor (2001) identified four stages that children pass through in their development a customers:

- During infancy (0-2 years), children become interested in brightly coloured television programming (which includes commercials), and by 18 months they start asking for products they've seen advertised in television.
- During the preschool period (2-5 years), children are at their most vunerable to television advertising. They still have a largely literal understanding of television, believing objects depicted in it are real, and they find it hard to resist tempting products.
- In the third phase (5-8 years), children become more sophisticated consumers of media, and by the end of the phase they have begun to display independence in terms of purchasing.
- During the final phase (9-12 years), this independence increases, as children become more critical media users and are attracted toward more adult forms of entertainment. At this stage, peer influence is more important than individual media use, and adult styles of consumption such as brand loyalty begin to appear.

Some issues remain contemptuous within this cognitive/piagetian approach. Firstly, it has been argued that children are able to discriminate between advertising and other forms of programming well before the model claims. Secondly, children's ability to understand the nature and function of advertising. The cognitivist argument is based on general television processing research in general, which portrays children's understanding of television as a simple matter of distinguishing between events on TV as "fantasy" and events around them as "reality". However, most of the research on children's understanding of advertising has focused on their ability to understand the economic principles involved in advertising itself, rather than semantic aspects of individual commercials.

_Advertising literacy_: "understanding" is both the recognition that advertising has a specific source distinct from other television programming, and a recognition of advertising's persuasive intent.

A meta-analysis of studies demonstrated a clear positive correlation between age and comprehension of persuasive intent, although this was less clear when ads were isolated from surrounding programming, suggesting an inability even among older children to identify "advertising" as a genre distinct from television itself. It has been suggested that there's no "magic age" at which an "understanding" great enough to cope with the wiles of advertisers can be said to truly take place, and that in many cases adults would fail the tasks that researchers give to children.

Cognitive maduration plays a part in children's media interaction, inasmuch as children have to develop the perceptual skills to identify formal features on TV. However, arguments that cognitive maduration is the main determinant of advertising awareness fail to explain how young children differ in terms of the products they request. Young children must be identifying with protagonists in commercials, if only on superficial characteristics such as gender, but this indicates the selective processing of advertisements, a task well beyond what the cognitive model predicted for 2 to 5 year olds.

Children spend increasing amounts of time alone, and these boundaries are exploited by advertisers, who emphasise the differences between members of the family rather than the similarities.

## Chapter 8: Young Children and Television

Studies such as the one examining the extraordinary complexity of _pretense_ that young children need to negotiate in order to appreciate _The Sooty Show_ are important for media psychology because they show how sophisticated young children's processing of media can be, and because they present innumerable problems for the crude behaviorism that still underpins much researh on children and television. For many years, the "effects" of media, invariably television, on children have been studied with negligible regard to content. It has generally been assumed that the only possible positive role that television might have is of formal education, as with _Sesame Street_.

### Fantasy versus reality: a simple choice?

The esteem in which fiction has been held has often turned to worry when contemplating its influence on young children. Two broad lines of argument are often advanced in relation to the harmful effects of television on children. The first corresponds to the "magic window" approach - the idea that television is a faithful recreation of reality and that children need to be protected from its harsh truths. The second approach is that all television is artificial (and by implication, worthless trash), and too much of it will simply rot children's brains.

Research into children's discrimination between symbolic representations and naturalistic representations. Many researchers have tried to investigate the cognitive processes by which young children learn to distinguish betwen fantasy and reality, with occassional regard to media (mainly television). However, there are problems with the idea of a simple dichotomy between what is real and what is fantasy, and the role of television in this transition is far from clear. Most people will find themselves on a continuum somewhere between these two extremes, and accept that although some television is real much is fantasy. Therefore, the important issue - as far as child development is concerned - is _discrimination_. Successful development requires an awareness of which bits are real and which are fantasy.

#### The development of children's understanding of the fantasy-reality distinction in television

The fantasy-reality distinction is made via a three-stage process. At the first stage (2 to 3 years of age), children fail to make a fantasy/reality distinction. Until they are 3 years old, children fail to imitate actions presented on video, although they have no trouble imitating the same actions when they are presented by a live actor.

The second stage occurs around the ages of 4 and 5, and consists of a flat denial of reality status for anything on television (#TODO: check research on fantasy/reality distinction in children) - it's been called an "impermeable membrane". For example, violence is generally dismissed as "acting", blood as "ketchup", and so on. It is not clear whether children are simply overgeneralising about the artificial nature of television, or whether this is part of the growing child's desire to be seen as more mature, and distancing themselves from childish notions of television as directly representational. Interview data with children aged 4 and younger seems to suggest a literalness in their perception of television content.

Awareness that some programmes are real and others are fantasy seems to arrive at some point between 6 and 7 years (with substantial individual differences). Many researchers attribute this awareness to the onset of "tele-literacy", the process by which children learn to "read" media texts. The clearest way this happens is through the identification of television genres - ads are identified first, at between 3 and 4 years of age, then cartoons, then news programmes - and eventually being able to distinguish children's from adult's programmes, and more subtle genres.

Doubts have been raised as to the fiability of many developmental theories that are based largely on verbal data, since young children are very unreliable interviewees. Many interview questions may be too abstract for young children to give sensible answers to.

It could be argued that the developmental path to distinguishing fantasy from reality represents nothing more cognitively sophisticated than an indocrination into adult ways of perceiving the world.

The assumption in most of the research on fantasy and reality in media is that age-related changes occur simply as a result of brain maturation. However, it has long been realised that cognitive development is inextricably linked with language development, and that social interaction plays a crucial part in the process. Perhaps the most important media-related behavior children can learn from adults is that, contrary to what adults say, much of what they watch on television is deeply important, and therefore highly "real", even if, in the cold hard light of rationality, they know it's "only acting" or "only a game".

Looking at television reception from the tradition of semiotics (the study of signs and symbols in communication): the _modality_ (apparent reality) of a message is either strengthened or weakened by certain characteristics of that message.

Wright et al. (1994) suggested that there are two properties of reality that children learn to identify: _factuality_ and _social realism_. The latter point extends to the perception of both real television people and fictional characters. In one study, older children (age 8/9) provided more complex descriptions of fictional characters (dispositions, traits, motives...) than of real people in their lives, which is not surprising in some ways given that media sheds light on those aspects of characters that are hidden in real life.

It has been suggested that, in later childhood, the more realistic the medium is the more emotionally involved will children become, though experimental results seem not to support that proposition. When 9- to 11-year-old children were shown a fictional drama in three different guises, reality status had very little impact on emotional response. Results suggest that whatever reality biases emerge around the age of 5, they are soon forgotten as children develop emphatic awareness and are able to draw analogies between fiction and real life.

_The Simpsons_ provides evidence that the power of the text, and of character creation, can override low modality markers, an effect that should prove even more powerful for soaps and other naturalistic drama.

### Script and schema explanations

Other studies have looked at children's processing of television narratives, and memory for television stories. These suggest that children's recall of television narratives is similar to that of stories presented in other media, such as pictures.

These findings suggest that young children are happier when events fall into place in a familiar manner that echoes their limited experience. This might explain why children are so captivated by TV advertising, where ads repeat ad nauseam, and children often respond by joining in with jingles and slogans. It also explain why children enjoy repetitive programme segments such as title sequences, and drawn-out "once-a-week" scenes. Silverstone (1993) argued that such repetitive sequences offer a sense of reassurance and stability, and the illusion of control - you _know_ what is coming next.

It may not be too much of a conceptual leap to argue that _all_ television, and maybe all experience, is understood in the context of narratives, or scripts. For example, in _The Sooty Show_ the puppets are "linguistically constituted as children", and the activities in which they participate resemble the kinds of games and interactions between children and parents. The situations are highly familiar to those in which children find themselves, and it does not matter that the protagonists are puppets representing animals, two of whom cannot speak; the "mischief-trouble" script overrides the low modality every time.

It's been argued that television actually gives children the experience of a rich variety of discursive and narrative forms. This is important for the development of "transformational power" - in effect, the ability to apply concepts to different situations. One example is the identification of a character type; the repetition of a particular fictional device through children's fictional media allows viewers to equate different characters as exemplars of a character type.

Messenger Davies suggested that children develop knowledge structures about the world that she called _schemata_. These set up certain expectations about cause and effect, and what will happen next. One way in which such schemata may work is in the development of understanding the notion of taxonomies, a device that can be seen throughout children's media whether there are classification systems available, such as attributes in Pokémon cards. It could be argued that these schemata may have some benefit in setting children up for the type of knowledge-building activities they will encounter in later education.

### Children's socialisation through media

If television might aid in the development of abstract cognitive structures (or narrative scripts), it may also teach children more directly about how to behave and respond in social situations. It could be argued that socialisation involves much more than simply copying behavior viewed on screen, especially when that behavior is strikingly inappropiate.

How children come to identify media characters as analogous to people they know in real life. It may be supposed that such awareness develops in tandem with their real-life person knowledge. Children as young as 28 months old were able to offer descriptive terms about real people based on personality traits such as "nice", "bad", "naughty" and so on.

Children from 7 to 11 years of age have been shown to evaluate characters on the basis of typical human personality dimensions, but it is not known at what stage, and how, children come to equate the huge variety of antropomorphic and human figures on television with the people around them in real life, and attribute consistent behavioral patters and personality traits to them.

The argument that viewers, even very young viewers, do not automatically attribute psychological qualities to television characters seems highly unlikely given the depth of the discussions that they have at school about real and fictional people on television. In a study, children actually produced more abstract psychological descriptions of child characters on television than of their own peers, although the overall number of concrete behavioral attributes was greater for real children. One explanation for this finding is that television provides viewers with unique insights into aspects of human character that remain inaccessible in real life.

Children's exposure to a vast array of human and nonhumans figures on television makes the media an important agent of socialisation.

_"Mere exposure effect"_ - familiarity breeds content rather than contempt. Findings suggest that early childhood viewing of character from different ethnic groups has a more positive effect even than explicitly antiracist material aimed at older viewers.

### Imagination, pretence, and theory of mind

One of the most important areas of developmental psychology at present is the literature on _theory of mind_, which is the ability to impute mental states to others and use this information to predict their behavior.

Although theory of mind is a _social_ cognitive skill, most of the research on the topic has treated it as a prpoerty that derives solely from cognitive maturation. In other words, TOM is seen as a biologically "hard-wired" behavior that emerges of its own accord as the human brain matures. This is surprising, because TOM is clearly about _other people_ and it's therefore hard to imagine that the social environment plays no part in its development. A study found superior TOM ability in children whose conversations with their mothers contained more abstract psychological descriptions of people and attributed internal motives to behavior. This provides support for the argument that cognitive development takes place simultaneously with language development and that the two are inextricably linked. However, it's unlikely that language alone, or cognitive maturation, can enable children to impute mental states to others; the benefit of experience must not be underrated. It's suggested that the more opportunities children have to learn about "other minds" - whether through talk or play - the sooner a theory of mind develops.

It's certainly possible that television provides preschool children with another opportunity to learn about other minds. Children's television contains so much rich interaction between clearly defined characters.

The results of Rosen et all (1997)'s study using a novel false belief task have two important implications for both media psychology and developmental psychology. First, it provides substantial evidence that children as young as 3 are able to make complex psychological judgements about characters and plot depicted in cartoons. Second, it reinforces some of the doubts about the validity of laboratory-based false belief tasks as measures of TOM. Elsewhere it has been argued that the commonly used tasks are too difficult for 4-years-old to pass, not because of their lack of cognitive sophistication but because their verbal abilities are not equipped to deal with the abstract nature of the questions they're asked. These results suggest that, under more natural conditions such as watching a normal cartoon, children are capable of dealing with false belief questions, maybe because the events they are asked to describe are more meaningful are more meaningful and interesting.

Children might see pretense not as a mental activity but instead as an action. In other words, when a child pretends to brush their teeth using a finger as a toothbrush, they are simply reenacting a familiar behavioral routine - no abstract analogy between fingers and toothbrushes is necessary, nor is the notion of pretense.

Little evidence has been provided regarding television having a detrimental effect on the amount of fantasy play. However, there does appear to be a link between television content and the type of play - for example, educational television can stimulate play involving props and materials. Overall, it seems that television cannot either stimulate or suppress imagination, although it may help shape the nature of childhood fantasies.

### Conclusion (Children)

There's a need to consider family interaction and parenting style as key factors in shaping children's understanding and interpretation of media content. We might also benefit from less concern with protecting children's "innocence" and instead studying the child as an active meaning-maker of cultural material who does not necessarily take the material's fantastical nature at face-value.

## Chapter 9: Media and Adolescence

For 50 years youth culture has continued to circulate fashions and ways of speaking that are unintelligible to adults, and therefore treated with the deepest suspicion. As a result, much of the research on adolecescent media use (like most media research) focused on its negative aspects - the "effects" of modelling bad celebrity behavior and listening to aggressive music.

Adolescence is arguably the most significant period of the life span when it comes to media psychology (media usage used to be significantly different between children and teens, though in recent years the lines have blurred as children younger and younger get access to personal devices and the internet). Moreover, their media use becomes more solitary. Peer influence becomes increasingly more important than parental influence, and much of his involves media content. Finally, adolescence is a period during which individuals are actively involved in constructing a coherent identity, and media may play a large part in supplying the cultural materials for this use.

### Media use in adolescence

One of the problems with any academic study of contemporary cultural life is that culture itself is constantly in flux. Give the snail's pace of academic research, studies of media use are invariably out of date long before they ever make it to publication. Much of the info for the chapter is drawn from a large survey whose results are probably already out of date because it coincided with a massive rise in the ownership of mobile phones and internet availability.

As children grow older, their tastes in television content change; boys become increasingly interested in sports, whereas girls become increasingly interested in soaps. At the same time, patters of viewing change too. Although parents are more likely to share the same taste in television with their children, the tendency for children to have their own devices means that adolescents watch increasing amounts in isolation.

#### Music

Some researchers have argued that, during adolescence, listening to music takes over from television as the preferred leisure medium. One important difference between watching shows and listening to music is that although television is not always the _primary_ activity during viewing hours, music is even less likely to be so. However, hours spent listening to music may rival television use if treated as a _secondary_ activity.

A study found that music has a less profound influence in terms of identity development than is sometimes asserted. This might reflect cultural changes at the start of the 21st century.

Livingstone and Bovill (1999) found that interest in music tends to be largely a stepping-off point for an interest in fashion, consumerism, romance and sex. It starts somewhat earlier for girls (around the age of 10 or 11), but when boys become interested in music it's more likely to remain their primary interest, because boys are less likely to use it to explore other areas of socialisation.

Music plays an essential part in dividing the cultural world into "teenage" and "adult" domains.

Concern over the lyrical content of pop music may be misplaced. The interpretation of lyrics is very different for teenagers and adults, and there may also be marked cultural differences in the interpretation of pop lyrics and videos.

### The role of media figures during adolescence

One of the most important funcions of media in adolescence is that they provide young people with a host of adult figures who play an increasingly important role in their lives. Traditionally, adolescence is a period when children seek out figures from beyond their immediate social environment who can act as heroes, idols or role models. Theories of adolescent development have argued that adult figures rom outside the family play an important function in guiding children toward adult life. Erikson referred to such relationships as _secondary attachments_, marking the transition between primary attachment to parents, and adult attachments.

These secondary attachments can fall into two broad groups: romantic attachments or identification attachments.

The second type is related to the process of role modelling, especially if the media figure completes a link to the world of adult work and occupations. Role models tend to be most useful when the qualities they offer are attainable. Adolescents' choice of role models is determined partly by broader culture.

One of the features of this stage in the life span is that children begin to see their parents as "real people" performing other roles beside parental functions, and this leads to a decline in their heroic status, as they might pale by comparison with the apparent virtues of adult figures in the media. Also during this period, stronger attachments are formed toward peers and romantic partners.

### Cultural functions of media use

The bedroom is a private space that separates the teenager from their parents (and siblings) but - through a shared media culture, and use of communications technology - connects them to peers. The private bedroom is a site where much creative work may be conducted, but these functions may be compromised if teenagers have to share space. It's also a space that they can use to present their emerging identity through the employment of posters, music, photographs...

_Room culture_. The use of bedroom objects changes through adolescence as media become increasingly integrated into the individual's sence of identity.

The use of media materials in constructing adolescent identities has been called _patchwork identity_ by some researchers. Media may be seen to offer young people such a range of lifestyle and consumer choices that they are able to construct a unique identity by mixing different styles. Some cultural scholars have seen this as an increasing trend toward individualism of life worlds and lifestyles, which is itself part of a gradual merging of public and private spheres. Where this is most evident is in the use of the internet as a means of connecting individuals across geographical and cultural boundaries.

### Media influences on adolescent body image

Most studies of body image support the argument that the moders Western ideal of the supper-slim, low waist-to-hip ratio female figure is the result of cultural changes rather than a biological imperative.

Two of the most important theoretical approaches that have been used to account for media effects on adolescent body dissatisfaction are _social comparison theory_ and _identification_.

Although there seems to be plenty of evidence supporting a media/body image link, the general consensus is that media play a supporting role among numerous factors behind the rise in eating disorders. Chief among these is peer influence, which is usually cited as the most important factor. But _media_ influences peer influence, so this influence can't be treated as entirely separate from media use.

## Chapter 10: Representations of social groups

Just as the mere presence of different ethnic groups might foster more positive attitudes among viewers, the reverse effect may also be present, which is that our dependency on media representations of these groups may, in some circumstances, force us to rely on stereotypes.

Innacurate or stigmatising media representation is more contentious when it involves brader social groups, notebly those defined in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, culture, sexual preference, or health status.

One of the chief concerns about the portrayal of different social groups in the media is that they will be _underrepresented_. However, underrepresentation is only one way in which minority groups may receive a raw deal from the media, as they can also be _misrepresented_. Stereotypes need not be negative in order to perpetuate prejudice; racist beliefs may be circulated through representations that appear positive on the surface. Even when media products explicitly tackle racism as an issue they can end up unwittingly casting the ethnic minority group as the root of the problem through the way the issue is framed in the narrative.

### Gender representation in the media

Women tended to be portrayed as passive victims waiting to be rescued by heroic male figures. A study of gender in advertising examined subtle ways in which women were cast in submissive roles by certain photographic angles and the use of passive postures. More often than men, female models were seen to be lying down, touching objects, or gesturing submissively toward a male model.

Three types of masculinity present in modern Western culture: hegemonic masculinity, conservative masculinity and subordinated masculinity.

Rather than counting categories and instances, the study of representations in media is more to do with the _cultural meanings_ that these representations hold for us.

Regarding relationships between men, it's been suggested that the lack of intimacy in men's friendships stems from a fear of homosexuality. Men in popular culture and the media tend to fall into three types: loners, close pals and duos.

Men were hardly portrayed with children without the mother being present. That said, the male role in parent-child interaction changes as the children get older. Men are much more likely to be seen engaging in child care with infants than with school-age children, and in the study not one instance was found of a man caring for a teenager. Men are also more likely than women to be engaged in educational activity with children, and also in eating and play (_quality time_). Women are still left to do all the dirty, less obviously appealing aspects of bringing up children.

### The effects of changing media representations of men

Although in most respects positive, for many authors the "feminisation" of men has had its downside in that it has led to tradicionally female activities being undermined or trivialised.

Are media images a reflection of reality, or do they help shape it? This frequently asked question rests at the center of media psychology, but really relies on how we define "reality", and how much influence with which we can really credit the media. Essentially, the question is a rerun of the "effects" debate around sex and violence, except that where issues such as gender and ethnicity are concerned the images are multiple and pervasive, almost impossible to avoid without opting out of media consumption altogether. Such is our dependency on media that the question os not whether media representation reflects reality, but whether they themselves _constitute_ reality (Craig, 1992).

### Representations of minority groups in the media

Clark's stage model (1969) was the first one to suggest a model to explain how minority groups are portrayed over time, though it doesn't seem to have stood the test of time. One of the issues with it is that it assumes a certain degree of homogeneity within the minority group itself. Although ethnic groups or sexual minorities obviously incorporate wide fluctuations, they are still more homogeneous than are groups such as the disabled, in which _disability_ can refer to a huge variety of characteristics that are shared by small numbers of people.

### Media representations of disability

Certain disabilities were represented more than others, notably locomotor problems and disfigurement, but also the category "behavior", which seems to be a bit of a ragbag category possibly including mental illness. Communication problems and incontinence were underrepresented.

Disabled individuals were least common in light entertainment, such as comedies. Representations of disability were most likely in local news, although typically they were the focus of the stories was on medical innovations or health policy (so the story was about the medics or academics rather than the people with the disability).

Taxonomy of stereotypes of disability in the media: "sweet innocent", "sage", "obsessive avenger".

How can the problem of stereotyping and underrepresentation be tackled? Some possibilities are involving disabled people as consultants, actors, media personnel, and so on, or through education.

### Media representations of mental health

Mental health is even more fragile a social construct than is disability in that it requires the identification of consistent patters of behavior, usually on one single classification system, and the nature of certain "syndromes" is often disputed.

"The presentation of a character as mentally ill is a decision that is made to serve very specific dramatic needs", and these needs "result in overemphasizing the negative and stigmatized images of the mentally ill, such as violence, bizarre behavior and failure".

Positive news stories about mental health do not receive anything like the high priority accorded to murders and other sensational crime stories [...] because the images of recovery and positive behavior are far less interesting and dramatic than are the spectacular negative aspects of the condition.

### Further issues & Conclusion

Stereotypes are used to reinforce divisions where blurred boundaries cause a problem for those in power.

Popular culture is infused with symbols; without some degree of stereotyping, we would never be able to recognise its analogy of the social world.

The concept of media representations is, for a start, predicated on the assumption that there is a preexisting social reality, entirely independent of the media, that is capable of being misrepresented by them. However, media penetrate so far into our psychological life that their content irrevocably shapes our understanding of the phenomena they communicate.

## Chapter 11: The Psychology of the Media Audience

The notion of "the audience" is of particular importance to media psychology because much of the time psychology attempts to deal with universal processes, designing studies in which the sample of participants is supposedly representative of an overall "population". Increasingly, social psychologists are moving away from such "reductionist" models of human behavior. The importance of social, cultural and historical context on behavior is becoming ever more a feature of psychological research. In media psychology this equates to a gradual shift from studying "the viewer" as a random human subject whose responses to stimuli can be easily measured and aggregated with other subject responses, toward understanding "audiences" and the variety of meanings with which they invest media texts.

Findings on diverse readings of media material let European media scholars to question the whole concept of messages that could be easily and unambiguously deciphered by readers, resulting in a more user-led approach that focused on the meaning of the text for the individual viewer. However, cultural studies and sociology's natural resistance to individual psychology has led them to frame the activity of reading in broader social groups (e.g., women, gay men, ethnic and cultural groups)

(#TODO: check out Höijer, 1992)

### "The audience" in media research

McGuire (1974) was one of the first to devise a model of media gratification based on theories of human motivation. Motivation can be either _cognitive_ or _affective_, and either _active_ or _passive_. Within these categories there are other forms of motivation. Active/passive modes can be either _internal_ or _external_. If we take as an example watching television when there's nothing else to do, an internal motivation would be boredom whereas an external one could be lack of company. These motivational theories are complemented by theories of gratifications, which are built on the concept of basic human needs.

### What is parasocial interaction?

Parasocial interaction - the complex web of relationships betwen individual media users and the people (or "figures"), both real and imaginary, who populate the media environment.

Parasocial interaction occurs when we respond to a media figure as though they/it were a real person. We speculate about people we have never met but whom we feel we "know" through our use, and our friends' and neighbors' use, of various media. In some case we may actively incorporate aspects of media figures into our behavior.

#### Parasocial interaction: the research literature

The concept of parasocial interaction resurfaced when the uses&gratifications tradition brought it back to life as an explanation for the gratifications users receive from interacting with people onscreen.

Two essential functions of PSI: companionship and personal identity. Other authors have argued that identification doesn't occur in parasocial relationships, because identification has a longer history than PSI.

Such is the importance of PSI that it can dictate the fortunes of a show.

Studies using the PSI scale have found that perceived realism and attraction to the media figure were highly correlated with PSI, which suggests that media users evaluate media figures along criteria similar to that they apply to people they encounter in the flesh.

#### Similarities between social and parasocial relationships

Turner (1993) noted that similarity ("homophily") was an important factor in the strength of the parasocial relationship, particularly in relation to attitudes, appearance, and background. However, these effects varied according to the type of media figure.

Findings suggest that if we examine social relationships at a cognitive level (i.e., how a single individual perceives other people), there is no reason why we should not treat parasocial relationships within the same framework. PSI studies can expose the shortcomings of traditional theories of relationships, such as requiring an element of reciprocity for "true relationships".

#### A model of parasocial interaction

Continuum of _parasociability_ suggesting that, the more remote interactants are from one another, the more features their relationship shares with a parasocial one. It also suggests that one of the important properties of any social encounter is its relationship possibilities.

Three levels of PSI: at level 1, the interaction is with a media figure that represents themself; at level 2 a human actor represents a fictional character; and at level 3 the figure is non-human. With each level, a social relationship with the media figure becomes less of a possibility.

The second part of the model attempts to explain the processes involved in the development of a parasocial relationship. The immediate response to an onscreen character involves making judgements about that person. In most cases we may actually carry over some person knowledge from previous encounters with the media figure. Two broad responses are possible here that have implications for the development of a relationship: we may _identify_ with the figure, or we may simply interact with them.

In cases where we identify with the figure, we may go on to incorporate some of that figure's behavior into our own. Alternatively, we may simply develop our relationship in social interaction, by discussing or gossiping about the future with others. This process can take place during the viewing itself, when it well may well transform our person judgements in the activity of viewing.

The identification or interation will be strengthened in further media encounters with that figure.

### Fans and fandom

Jenkins' (1992) model of fandom is based on four ideas:

- Fans adopt a distinctive, non-casual mode of reception, taking it beyond the individual viewing episode.
- Fandom constitutes a particular interpretive community, and is fundamentally a social pursuit.
- Fandom constitutes a particular art world, with its own aesthetic standards, conventions, critical evaluations...
- Fandom constitutes an alternative social community, and is therefore attractive to minority groups, and individuals whose interests are otherwise pursued in isolation.

Fantasy figures have always played an important role in parasocial attachment, particularly in adolescence (secondary attachments to adult figures oher than parents are an important part of the passage to adulthood).

### Conclusion (Audiences)

One of the issues that cause a problem for traditional psychological theories of media is the adherence to a social-audience perspective, in which the audience is regarded as a social group that exists prior to the introduction of a given medium. Psychology would benefit from viewing audiences as determined, albeit only to an extent, by the media themselves. Contemporary media users interact with a huge cast of real and imaginary figures in a media environment in which fantasy and reality continually overlap and invite all manner of irrational responses. The realism of contemporary soaps has no historical parallel and it's meaningless to search for one.

## Chapter 12: News and Current Affairs

Television news is much less effective at conveying semantic information than is newsprint. There is less time to present more than the essential facts concerning a story; news programming is sequential, so stories that we find less interesting may result in a lapse of atenttion or even changing activities; and since the news don't refresh our memory of the facts surrounding a story, we may find ourselves losing the thread.

For more isolated viewers such as older adults and people with restricted mobility, the news is perceived as a way of staying in touch with the outside world.

### Content-based approaches to news media

Broadly speaking, there are two approaches that have been adopted with reference to news in media and communications research. The first concerns the __content__ of the news itself, whereas the second examines the __impact__ on the viewer or reader.

Content-based approaches examine the way the news is put together by journalists and broadcasters to achieve certain effects.

_Discourse analysis_ (DA): the study of talk and text. DA comes in many forms: some versions examine language primarily as a toolkit for constructing the world and adopting positions in argument, others prefer a definition of discourse that incorporates broader cultural practices, and some adopt explicit ideological positions. The form that has been applied mostly to news discourse is _critical discourse analysis_; CDA is rooted in semiosis, by which is necessary to study more than language itself. CDA also doesn't begin with the text itself; it regards any text as an account of a real issue that exists beyond the text.

When talking about the precise language used in news stories, it's important to always remember that choice of words is not accidental; texts are built from a series of optional terms and expressions within a given vocabulary or grammar. Grammatical subtleties are also quite relevant; for example, the same sentence written in passive or active voice can create two different interpretations.

The problem with content-based approaches in general is that although they reveal some interesting linguistic and rhetorical devices, they don't attempt to specify what effect these devices have on readers and viewers.

### Information-processing approaches to news reception

The study of news reception (how readers and viewers actually understand and interpret news) has followed two broad theoretical approaches: the short-term cognitive approach, and the cultivation approach, which looks at people's general media use and their understanding of news content.

In general, our memory for news is not particularly good, even for news programmes on television. Partly this is due to distracting visual footage that does not always tally perfectly with the verbal material. Some producers have tried dealing with this by delaying showing pictures until the details of the story have been read out. Research has suggested that this only works if the visual images induce a positive or neutral mood in the viewer. If the images shown are negative, it would be better to present them upfront, because they inhibit the recall of the precding verbal material and enhance recall of subsequent verbal material (probably because emotive pictures heighten viewers' attention).

Much news production practice seems to be based on faulty psychology. News producers have long organised bulletins in clusters of stories based on thematic similarity. This practice has evolved partly as a result of newspaper practic and partly in the belief that viewers and listeners find such story packaging easier to follow and recall. However, research indicated entirely the opposite; items are better remembered when embedded in a series of ites of different thematic.

#### News framing

In actual news reception, our recall for events needs to be examined in the light of our understanding of those events through broader frameworks of knowledge. Much of the news washes over us because we have missed, or not understood, key elements in understanding the story. Some of these processes relate back to standard theories of text comprehension - notably, the _framing_ theory of Bransford and Johnson (1972), which suggests that learning is futile without a properly understood context.

Research indicates that no matter how much time is devoted to a particular issue, if viewers hav neither the interest nor the expertise they are likely to switch off, either actually or metaphorically.

Four salient aspects of the text (two news stories about planes that were shot down) that created a frame for interpretation (Entman, 1991):

- Agency: who was responsible for the incident?
- Identification: with whom is the audience invited to identify?
- Categorisation: attributions that the media source is making in the story.
- Generalisation: where did the blame lie for the incident?

The study of parasocial interaction between viewers and newscasters demonstrate the importance of the human news source, certainly in terms of keeping the viewers watching It's very important that we find this news source credible, so newsreaders need to communicate a sense of _trust_, especially given the finding that television is considered a more trustworthy source of news than newspapers.

However, newsreaders may influence the audience interpretation of the material in ways of which they themselves may be unaware; the possibility that even the facial expressions of newsreaders may bias a viewer's response to the information being reported has been studied.

Although we expect our newsreaders to be trustworthy and impartial, we nevertheless prefer them to display human qualities. One interviewee explained that the newsreaders' banter was reassuring, especially when the news was bad; if they could find time to share a joke, it meant that life goes on regardless despite the awful events in the rest of the world. This reassurance provides continuity for viewers.

## Chapter 16: The Internet

Online communication is profoundly different from face-to-face interaction. In cyberspace, we must do without the gestural and other nonverbal cues that convey paralinguistic information to supplement the verbal content of our communication. Prosodic cues - emphasis on certain words, mimicked accents, pauses, and other paralinguistic verbal utterances (um, ah, etc.) - that also add meaning to the words we speak are likewise absent in online interaction. All we have left are the bare bones of the verbal text itself, although we persist in bringing oral social conventions into this written conversation.

For some users, freedom from these visual and oral modes of communication may actually bring benefits. Our appearance and manner of speaking can convey information that profoundly affect the nature of our face-to-face interaction.

Internet communication can be empowering for users who feel marginalized in face-to-face interaction; belonging to internet groups can lead to increases in self-esteem through group membership. Also _diasporic cybercommunities_.
