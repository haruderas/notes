## Chapter 1: What Is Media Psychology?

The emergence of the Internet and other interactive media networks have forced us to reconsider our concept of mass media as a medium where communication is ostensibly unidirectional. This is only to be expected, because each medium shapes society by its own terms, so we can never have a universal definition of "media" - the concept is forever in a state of flux.

Media are effectively ciphers, empty of meaning, until we perceive some form of content, which is then treated as a message.

Every decade in the last 50 years has seen major devlopments in mass communications and media. Keeping a finger on the pulse of change is difficult when you are trying to discover universal truths about human nature. [...] The research has been conducted in response to calls for scientific evidence for the harmful influence of media, rather than an intellectual need to understand how media in general might influence behavior. As a result, studies have been devised that have the best chance of securing a statistically significant outcome for a causal relationship between violent media and aggressive behavior. Despite widespread agreement as to the shortcomings of muh experimental research on media violence, its legacy has been bequeathed to the media themselves, and to politicians, who continue to make unsubstantiated statements about the direct relationship between media violence and antisocial behavior.

## Chapter 2: Theoretical Issues in Media Research

The "media effects" tradition of research has probably had the greatest impact of all media research on public life in the last 50 years. Concerns about the negative psychological effects of media are so commonplace that they are barely questioned outside academia. [...] Behaviorism is at its most persuasive when children are concerned, and so it's not surprising that the most popular behaviorist media research was that carried out by Bandura, who found that children who had been exposed to violence, either live or recorded, performed significantly more aggressive acts. There are, however, many problems with these findings.

After behaviorism, the task facing psychology involved an attempt to open the "black box" postulated by behaviorists in place of the mind, or brain. Effects research subsequently developed along two separate paths: the physiological perspective and the cognitive perspective. Other researches working in the same tradition attempted to integrate these approaches, such as the theory of "excitation transfer", building on top of the two-factor model of emotion.

In many areas of media studies, the "effects" tradition has acquired a bad name, bracketed with psychology in general, being charged with "individualizing" media concerns and ignoring wider social and cultural contexts. [...] The term "influences" is more appropiate, because it implies a complex interplay of social and environmental factors on behaviorof which media is one part, whereas the term effects suggests, perhaps erroneously, that the causal relationship between media and human behavior can be studied in isolation.

_Cultivation theory_: a more global approach to media effects that regards media as a key element in cultural socialization as a whole, looking at the way in which individuals grow up in a society in which media help shape our understanding of the world.

### Uses and gratifications research

Uses and gratifications research (U&G) approaches individual differences instead, and its research draws on traditional psychological theory, but from the Maslow school of humanism rather than from behaviorism. In this approach, the viewer (or general media user) is in control, and rather than studying the person as a passive recipient of effects, U&G researches look at the _motives_  for using media and the _needs_ that media use gratifies. U&G research, above all else, studies how and why people use media in general. (pag. 23)

Papachrissi and Rubin (2000) examined the factors that were most likely to predict people's use of the Internet. They identified five motives:

- Interpersonal utility (online social interaction)
- A way of passing time
- Information seeking
- Convenience
- Entertainment

Some Internet users use the medium as a functional alternative to social interaction, particularly those who had difficulties in making friends and forming relationships in face-to-face communication.

Three key ways in which individuals develop "dependency relations" with media (the dependency theory of DeFleur and Ball-Rockeach, 1989):

- Media provides information that enables us to _understand_ the world, which at the level of "self-understanding" provides us with information about ourselves - it enables the creation of identities by allowing us to interpret our behavior and compare ourselves to others.
- We may depend on media for _orientation_, either in terms of action (deciding to go on a diet, or voting in an election) or interaction (how to deal with social situations).
- Media provides us with opportunities to _play_ (either for solitary relaxation, or social activity like visiting the cinema).

### The "active audience"

Rather than treating the media user as an isolated television viewer locked into dependency relationships with media, __audience theory__ sees media users as social groups that are strongly influenced by media, but - like U&G subjects - far from passive. Much audience reseach has focused on the cultural _meanings_ that user derive from media.

One ofbejctive of this school of thought was to replace the two-step flow concept of communication (sender-message-receiver) as the dominant model of media research with a _circuit_, in which information is encoded (e.g. using television production codes) and then decoded by the audience. The idea behind this model was that concepts such as two-step flow and the "hypodermic needle" theory of media effects treat messages as fixed by the sender, and reception processes as determined by the message content. Hall (1980) suggested that there are three ways in which audiences could "decode" media messages:

1. The _dominant_ code, by which viewers select the "preferred reading" intended by the producers.
2. The _negotiated_ code, by which audiences modify the message, perhaps on the basis of personal experience.
3. The _oppositional_ code, by which the message is treted with deep suspicion, as biased estabilishment propaganda.

Research (Morley, 1980) has suggested that the social and cultural characteristics of the audience partly dictate which form of encoding they will use.

Some authors have asserted that the circuit model can perhaps be applied to news and current affairs media (because it was designed with this sort of material in mind), but offers inappropiate explanations for audience response to popular cultural material, such as soap opera and pop music.

Some of the most exciting research in the active audience tradition is Henry Jenkins' work on fandom, which differs from much of the literature on media audiences because it credits the audience with much more interpretative power - here, media products are viewed not as political propaganda, disturbing imagery, or texts encoded to produce certain readings, but instead as cultural material from which viewers and readers can construct identities.

## Chapter 3: Research Methods in Media Psychology

Today scientists are perhaps nore modest about the inferences they can draw from their results, and of the kind of psychological processes that are the most suitable for the experimental method.

Faces seen in close-up are responded to more intensely than those seen in smaller scale.

### Survey methods

If we are interested in studying everyday experiences of media we hve to resort to more contrived methods of data collection (which typically involve asking people what media they use) and devising indirect measures of its effects or influences. Typically, such research is done as part of a large project using a variety of methods, known as a survey. The survey was the principal tool of cultivation research, in which disillusionment had set in regarding the kinds of information gleaned through laboratory-based studies. The trend in audience research has moved towards correlational designs, in which researchers study associations, or reltionships, among a number or measured (dependent) variables instead of studying the effects of one variable on another.

The association between two variables is a useful starting point in an analysis, but bivariate analysis have a notorious habit of throwing up spurious relationships. To mitigate this, we need to weight the correlation betwen these two variables according to the correlations between both of these variables and another third variable. This is called __partialling out__ the effects of a third variable. This kind of partial correlational analysis provides the building blocks for a hugely influential statistical approach known as _multivariate analysis_. In recent years, psychologists and other social scientists have devised models of behavior on the basis of many different variables, all entered into the same equation. The goal of such analysis is to examine the extent to which variables predict one another, both individually and collectively. This way, __models__ are created by lumping together all the demographic variables, measurig their combined influence on all the media use variables, and portray this analysis by means of a path diagram.

The bedrock of the survey is the questionnaire, although the term "questionnaire" covers a vast range of different instruments. The choice of measure used depends entirely on the analysis you are intending to conduct. Focus groups are ofen used in an exploratory fashion, to generate ideas and materials for large-scale data collection using questionnaires and scales.

### Analysis of media texts

Content analysis is most frequently used in media research in order to investigate the nature of media representations. Typically, a researcher constructs a schedule based on the possible types of representation (e.g., ethnic groups on British television) and the different texts to be covered (e.g., different genres of television show). Usually, categories in content analysis are not determines until all the material has been coded.

Analysing data gathered through content analysis poses problems different from those encountered when analysing experimental or survey data, becase they normally come in the form of category counts ("nominal" data). The most basic type of analysis for this kind of data is the chi-square test, which can be conducted with only a few categories and data spread in a _contingency table_. There are sophisticated techniques for dealing with larger contingency tables, known as _log-linear analysis_. This works a little bit like the model approach to correlational data described in the section on survey research: you predict interactions between different factors and test these as a set of equations.

There is no need for content analysis to be quantitative; often, the data we have is not suited to statistical testing, because either we prefer not to assign the data to inflexible categories or the category boundaries are blurred. When this is the case, we may use qualitative content analysis in order to build up a taxonomy of materials, or to demostrate a process or theory that explains the data.

A different approach to textual analysis altogether is to perform qualitative analysis of verbal or vidual data. This is a useful approach if we are interested in the _meaning_ of texts rather than in simply counting the frequency of occurrence; figures alone do not possess any explanatory power, and for that we need some form of interpretative analysis, such as __discourse analysis__.

There are two broad traditions of discourse analysis, influenced by different concerns and theoretical orientations. The first tradition is primarily concerned with language use, which requires close attention to the linguistic features of texts; in media researh it has been used to study the structure of news stories, with particular emphasis on narrative style. The second strand hails from the critical social science tradition, and the emphasis is on the text as deeply embedded in a variety of social and discursive _practices_ that together constitute a version of reality. We might use this form of analysis to investigate the way that formal realism is produced in a television show. Discourse analysis has been criticised for its subjectivity and lack of formal procedure. In psychology, however, more formal procedures for conducting discourse analysis have been articulated, and there is a growing acceptance of this kind of research. Furthermore, discourse analysis feeds into related techniques such as rhetorical analysis, which has proved useful for studying the nature of advertising, and narrative analysis, which has been used to study both textual material and interview data.

## Chapter 4: The Effects of Media Violence

Imitation of violent behavior on television is likely to be influenced by the status of the aggressor. A common complaint is that media coverage of violence glamourises the behavior. There is some evidence that the attractiveness of, and degree of identification with, aggressive models enhances the effects of media violence. Nevertheless, the biggest effects have generally been found in the most artificial studies.

Two theories have been proposed to explain media effects of aggression: modelization and excitement transfer. Both have had serious criticisms levied at them. The biggest problem for excitation transfer theory, however, is the fat that violent media are not necessarily the most exciting stimuli to which viewers are exposed: erotic stimuli have been shown to not only produce higher physiological arousal than did the violent and control media, but also induced study subjects to be more aggressive. This finding clearly supports excitation transfer, but provides mixed evidnce for a media violence effect. In fact, studies that have used combinations of erotic and violent stimuli have produced the highest aggression measures of all.

- __Desensitisation__: an important issue related to excitation transfer, or any physiological theory of media violence, is the effect of repeated exposure to violent material over a long period of time. Short-term effects indiced in the laboratory are spectacular in themselves, but surely don't the effects wear off after sufficient time as habituation sets in? The result, it is argued, is desensitisation to violence, both on television and on real life. Research doesn't quite support this, as large-scale analyses of media violence have consistently noted strong effects for men, who are generally much heavier consumers of violent media.

### Characteristics of the users of violent media

Personality, or dispositional, variables have been increasingly built into media violence research designs. An important one is the level of aggression displayed by participants at the outset of a study; _trait aggresion_ is the biological tendency for an individual to display aggression. Results on this matter have been mixed, however.

It's actually been found that people with innate aggressive an antisocial tendencies consume _less_ media than normal people.

There's relatively little data collected on people's reasons for actively seking violent media in the first place. This question can't be answered without first taking a closer look at what actually constitutes "violent media", a major problem with the literature. One of the features of the media violence literature has been a tendency to ignore different genres of media to the effect that the category "violent media" can encompass incredible diverse material, both in genre classification and in picture quality and realism. The definition usually used for violent media is to broad to capture the type of media that is actively sought after for its violence: most films that receive certificates based on violent content are valued for other reasons, such as comic appeal or general artistic merit. In the purest sense, the term "violent media" refers to cultural material that has little to recommend it apart from its violent content - films that would be classified as "video nasties".

Two fundamental reasons why an individual (or group) might seek violent media: simple curiosity and the fact that violent media presents viewers with a challenge.

The attraction of "forbidden fruit" for teenage boys is aprt of a broader rite-of-passage that is part of the preparation for adulthood; seeing an adult-only movie has become one fo the targets of early adolescence. There's great importance in the group viewing context for the enjoyment of violent movies.

Empirical research offers little support for the __catharsis__ hyphotesis, but this may reflect the fact that media violence in the laboratory tends to be unexpected, and not actively selected by participants. Few studies have been properly designed to investigate the cathartic effect of media violence.

Little relation has also been found between people's enjoyment of media and the amount/degree of violence in said media. It's been suggested that a key element in the media violence debate is the _meaning_ of violence for viewers, which may differ sharply among individuals. This element has been largely neglected in the laboratory research.

### Cognitive factors in media violence

For cultivation researchers, the primary concern was not that violence would be imitated, but that the prevalence of violence in the media resulted in a climate of fear in the population at large. This "mean world" effect was demonstrated in studies that found that heavy viewers of television were likely to overestimate the amount of violent crime that took place in the real world.

Most public concern about media violence concerns the effects of films and entertainment in general. Cultivation theory forces us to look more broadly, particularly at the role that news bulletins and current affairs television play in perpetuating fear about crime. Memory for disturbing features of TV news tends to be more powerful than for other kinds of information, thereby making crime and violence more salient to the viewers. At an individual level, negative news bulletins have been found to intensify personal concerns, even when not directly related to the content of the programme. Concerns about the effect of television news have, however, tended to be downplayed in relation to the effect of entertainment. This result perhaps stems from the opinion that news programmes are faithful reflections of reality, and that it is simply a matter of public interest to be informed about real-life violence.

One way in which media violence might elecit aggressive behavior in viewers over long periods of time (a lifetime, perhaps) is through cognitive processing rather than crude behavioral responses. Cognitive effects of media can be grouped into two very broad categories: they may elicit obtrusive thoughts, or they may work at a more conscious level in that they stimulate ideas about how to behave. It is the latter mechanism that is thought to provide the basis for imitation of screen violence, rather than the learning-and-reinforcement process argued by behaviorists.

A more cognitive-assiciationist approach to media violence involves __priming__ as its key mechanism. According to this theory, implicit memories of violent scenes can be reactivated if appropiate cues are provided. When individuals are required to make decisions, the priming of violent stimuli may influence their choice. Another way in which media violence might prime subsequent behavior is by activating certain patterns of cognition or behavior that have become formulaic over time. The effects of media violence might well depend on the meaning that the violence has for the viewer.

The findings of research on the effects videogames play are even more inconclusive than in the media violence literature in general.

Three contexts need to be considered to understand media violence (Shaw, 2001):

- The _narrative_ itself has a powerful influence on viewers' responses; by setting up a storyline and creating characters, viewers are able to interpret the violence, and through the use of social scripts may even be able to anticipate it.
- The program or movie _genre_ may determine viewers' anticipation.
- Viewers' own experiences - both of viewing violent media and of real-life violence - will have a moderating effect for their interpretation of and reaction to a violent incident on screen.

Media effects research has been using inappropiate stimuli for a long time. Might be interesting to ask the _creators_ of the violent material how do they think it works, and why they put it all together the way they do.

## Prosocial Effects of Media

Tales of prosocial effects of media suggest ways of communicating socially useful material without dressing it up as education.

Much of the psychological literature on media is somewhat _reactive_; there are many studies of the effects of violent media, but relatively few examining the effects of other kinds of media, even though they should ostensibly share certain characteristics.

At low levels, perceptual and cognitive responses to televisual stimuli should hold true whatever the programme content; at higher levels, processes such as identification and parasocial interaction with media figures, or comprehension of story lines and the "reading" of generic and formulaic media styles, should shape understandings and responses to all televised material.

An important difference between the antisocial and prosocial effects of media is that the former are almost invariably accidental. Probably no media producer has ever deliberately set out to produce antisocial effects, but they frequently set out to create material that will have positive long-term benefits on consumers, whether it be a soap opera storyline that informs viewers about health issues, or an educational programme for children.

### The "effects" research tradition

What is "prosocial behavior"? Whereas studies of media and antisocial behavior have concentrated on aggression and violence, studies of prosocial and behavior have been more diverse. The most heavily researched behavior is _altruism_, or helping, frequently studied using experimental methods. Less easily researched behaviors include _sharing_ and _empathy_.

Studies of viewer empathy have produced a mixture of findings. On of them (Zillman & Bryant, 1975) suggests that empathy is strongly determined by character judgements, usually involving some degree of moral evaluation. Increasingly, the relatives of victims of murder and other unlawful deaths ar invited to give press conferences, because the police are well aware of the emphatic impact of television, and the resultant increased likelihood of members of the public coming forward with useful information.

Thus far, the effects for prosocial effects of media is mixed. One problem is that, as with violent content, prosocial content is usually embedded deep within the narrative context of a dramatic prodution, so we can't quite classify a program as "prosocial".

### The effects of "prosocial media"

_Sesame street_ has been the focus of most of the research into educational media, as it was designed with prosocial aims in mind. Rice, Houston, Truglio and Wright (1990) found that Sesame Street viewing was a good predictor of vocabulary knowledge at ages 3 and 5, but older children did not get this benefit; those still watching at ages 6 and 7 were more likely to be slow learners. The authors explained this in terms of __quick incidental learning__, which is more effective with 3-year-olds than 5-year-olds. It was also found that the group of children who benefited the most from wtching the show were those with higher socioeconomic status, which might be explained by the finding that _parental mediation_ (discussion between parents and children about the show's contents) enhances the effect of viewing.

The belief that watching television is passive activity from which it's impossible for children to elarn anything has prevented greater use of television as an educational medium, but it's clear que a los of verbal and gestural material in children has its roots in audiovisual content.

Whether or not media produce the psychological effects claimed by many social scientists, there is no doubt that they are invaluable menas of communicating information, whether it is promoting desirable behavior, communicating health messages, etc. How effectve those campaings are depends on the type of information being communicated. In a couple of studies that backfired (in that they _decreased_ self-efficacy related to the desired behavior among the group they were targeting), it's been suggested that the use of negative health messaged backfired: rather than shaming the public into changing their behavior, it inadvertedly provided them with a readly available set of excused for _not_ changing their behavior.

This study raises a commin problem with using psychology for health communication and other public service announcements: media material is often devised by educated, middle-class people whose idea of a persuasive message may not ring true with the public at large. Of course, there are instancs in which health communication in the media has been at odds with other media representations of health behavior; smoking is possibly the best example of a true media effect.

In many parts of the world, information about social issues is embedded within popular drama. Prosocial soaps follow the sam broad structure as do soaps in Europe and North America, except that the storylines are explicitly prosocial; even in the West soaps often feature storylines that are intended to educate as much as entertain. There is always some doubt about the effectiveness of such shows, as long-standing attitudes may be resistant to change. Getting the message may require viewers to do a critical reading of the media text, and audiences are often not as sophisticated as producers assume they are. Media psychologists need to study the meanings that media hold for audiences, rather than assuming that their effects are homogenous. Nevertheless, the findings from global soap operas indicate that, when positive social messages are embedded in narrative texts, they can have a substantial impact, even if only on public awareness of important issues.

### Parental mediation

Parental mediation is, at its simplest, the idea of a parent as a coviewer of content with the child. Rather than leaving the child "vulnerable" to the unmediated influence of undesired material, when the adult views television with the child there is an opportunity to discuss and explain some of the more disturbing material, and to consolidate the prosocial or educational content. Despite the fears, children are much mure likely to view adult material when coviewing with an adult; in other words, it is the adults who make the decisions about viewing material. However, it might be that coviewing tends to be incidental.

The view of many parents is that the only way to prevent children from watching undesirable media is to simply prohibit viewing. An study found that, in their sample, restricted viewers generally saw less of everything - rather than controlling the _quality_ of television their children watch, restrictive parents simply control the _quantity_. There are several problems with blanket restrictions on viewing: policing exposire to undesirable media is virtually impossible, and the "forbidden fruit" effect may be stronger for children whose media use is subject to such censure. Given the easy access to media children have today, the need for parents and children to share viewing experiences assumes greater importance than in the past. Simple coviewing isn't the answer: effective mediation requires parents to discuss the programme content with the child, perhaps explain ambiguous or disturbing material, or follow up on concepts from the viewing session.

Not only has parental mediation been found to enhance the learning effect, it's also possible to blunt the negative effects of television by discussing the relevant issues. When using mediators of either gender, certain types of content can effect huge decreases in school children's stereotypical attitudes, whereas watching alone actually produced a small increase. With older children (11 or 12), mediation still had a powerful effect, but there was also a decrease when viewing alone, suggesting that by this age children are able to process the prosocial message without adult help. It has been suggested that children as young as 7 are able to understand quite complex moral messages contained in sitcom storylines).

There might be both different styles of mediation for different material, as well as differences between the mediators themselves. A study using telephone survey identified four mediation styles:

- _Nonmediators_, who might coview with children but never discuss content.
- _Optimists_, whose mediation consists of mostly positive comments about the content, and who tend to be generally trusting of television.
- _Pessimists_, who make generally negative or sceptical comments to their children, and tend to be generally distrustful of television.
- _Selectives_, which have a more or less equal balance of negative and positive contributions.

Simple coviewing and prohibitive viewing are largely ineffective means of modifying children's interpretation of television. The nature of parent-child discussions about television are therefore likely to rely heavily on parental attitudes toward the media, and on existing communication patterns within families and on general parental style.

### Conclusion

Identifying and isolating prosocial content in standard media is much harder than coding acts of violence and aggression - not because it isn't there, but because it has to be understood and interpreted in its narrative context. Slowly, media violence researchers are appreciating that the same is true of violent content.

The mixed success in communicating prosocial media messages - attempting to change negative aspects of health behavior, or unacceptable attitudes - highlights the variety of "readings" that are open to media users, and indicates the need for more carefully targeted campaigns. Multiple readings exist for all forms of media message, not only the prosocial ones.

## Chapter 7: Advertising

For advertisers, the ability to manipulate consumer impressions and decision-making has been the key to success. If product sales increase following a carefully orchestrated campaign, the persuasive tactics have evidently worked, although as with any natural experiment it is hard to estabilish cause and effect due to the lack of control over confounding variables.

For media users, advertising will undoubtedly have an effect on their lives in the same way as other media, but we try desperately to avoid being influenced, or to deny it, perhaps through the "third-person effect" (individuals perceive that media messages have more effect on other people than on themselves). This is because advertising, unlike other media, is founded on a theory of media effects. It exists __only__ to dupe and persuade, and if it fails to dupe and persuade, it fails completely. Increasingly, the secret of successful advertising has been the extent to which the advertiser can disguise the ad, or at least disguise the elements of the ad that achieve the intended psychological effect. This is testimony to our stubbornness as media consumers not to be influenced by information that we perceive as vulgar, low culture, and over which we have no control.

### Cognitive and behavioral effects of advertising

Academic research into the effects of advertising tends to fall into two groups of effects produced by ads: _perceptual_ effects, such as low camera angles to make the speaker seem authoritative (a tactic now abandined by political advertisers); and _attitudinal_ effects, which examine the short- and long-term impact of an ad on the consumer's impression of the brand and product. More generally, research has focused on the effectiveness of ads in shaping consumer behavior. Most research on advertising rarely queries the cumulative effects of continuously viewing ads on human behavior.

#### Perceptual effects

Most of the research on perceptual effects of advertising have drawn on the information-processing approach of the 1950s that tended to view memory and attention as discrete cognitive processes. While ti has been argued that attention is the key issue for television advertising, the nature of attention is complex, and there are more ubtle factors mediating between attentional processes and the effectiveness of advertising.

The idea that advertising may work at a level below full consciousness has long been a feature of mainstream psychology itself. Most psychology graduates will have encountered the concept of _subliminal advertising_, perhaps in relation to the study of iconic memory. _Iconic memory_ is the term given to the storage of a fleeting visual stimulus, typically a grid of 9 letters present on a screen for a brief period (50 ms or so). Experimental research has suggested that our retention of such displays is better than we realize.

These findings would seem to support the beliefe, still widely held in the business world, that advertising messages can be injected into the memory through exposing audiences to brief snatches of persuasive text. There is, however, no real evidence of this working; dspite that, the concept of subliminal advertising has stuck within modern culture (though if we consider product placement as subliminal advertising, the success rate is somewhat higher). There is, though, evidence that subliminal-type effects may occur with material that is not directly perceived by viewers. Results suggest that, if subliminal advertising is capable of influencing consumer behavior, it is probably through the process of cognitive _priming_.

It seems certain that some fo the success of advertising must be atributed to unconscious processing. We can do little about our memory for advertising jingles and slogans, which is usually a function of simple exposure. If we hear a jingle enough times on television or radio it will inevitably seep into our unconscious through the reactivation of neuronal firing patterns.

Our exposure to ads is rarely governed by conscious, deliberate attention. Television and cinema advertising have been hugely successful because the ads have a captive audience, particularly in the cinema. The increasing sophistication of television advertising over the years reflects the need to compete with programming for entertainment value. Research in this area suggests that programme genre has a strong effect on cognitive processing of commercials. Both violent and humorous programmes have been linked with low recall of advertising material. In both cases it seems that emotional response blunts the degree of attention that viewers can pay to advertising.

The latest challenge for advertisers is how to maximize the effectiveness of advertising over the internet. Businesses continue to shell out for internet advertising because it's relatively cheap and can allow the provision of detailed product information. From a cognitive perspective, internet advertising is never likely to be as effective as cinema and television advertising because of the user control over the medium. Interactive advertising (in which the user can dismiss the ad at the click of a button) cannot use many of the persuasive tactics of traditional advertising - ads interrupt shows or films and have time to develop storylines and characters, or they sit on a page, slowly sinking into the subconscious while the reader peruses the story alongside.

#### Attitudinal effects

Theories of subliminal advertising work on the assumption that attention and perception are sufficient motivation for consumers to buy products, as though shopping is an activity conducted by solitary individuals in a state of trance. Most consumer decisions, however, are made on a largely rational basis, and many take place in a social context. In the history of advertising, advertisers soon felt the need to look beyond perception and memory and toward socially oriented behavior, particularly the study of consumer attitudes.

Increasingly, the "effectiveness" of an ad is measured by whether consumers _like_ the product on offer and the advertisement itself, rather than whether the ad has actually inspired them to purchase the product. Instead of studying perceptual effects of ads, there has been increased interest in their emotional appeals, and the use of music and humour as effective devices.

One of the most heavily researched areas in the psychology of persuasion concerns the degree of _personal involvement_ with the issue or product concerned. Petty and Cacciopo (1981) developed this idea in their Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion, in which they argued that if consumers are highly involved with a product (such as if it means a lot to them), they will devote more thought ("elaboration") to the message contained in the advertisement.

The focus on the role of advertising in self-concept and identity construction has shifted the emphasis in advertising away from product-oriented ads toward consumer-oriented ads, with a corresponding shift from perceptual features of ads toward discursive and narrative features (sometimes characterised as the distinction between "hard sell" and "soft sell"). They found that the hard sell and soft sell approaches had different effects on different people. Consumers who scored highly on a test of "self-monitoring" - in other words, those who are socially more self-conscious, and likely to adapt their behavior according to their behavior according to the situation - had more favorable attitudes toward soft-sell ads. This happens, the authors maintained, because such consumers are more image conscious and thus respond better to advertising eliciting moods and associations rather than to hard-sell advertising with more factual information about a product. Low self-monitors, on the other hand, prefer hard-sell ads that describe the benefits of the product; such consumers take a more pragmatic approach to life, and are less concerned with image.

When we compare real social groups in their demographic characteristics, we find equally important differences in response to advertising. For some time, business have based their marketing strategies around consumer profiles - it's standard practice to select the target audience on the basis of demogrphic characteristics before deciding what sort of ad to commission. In advertising, such profiling is known as _psychographics_ - a picture is built up of the typical consumer, and the ad is designed to appeal to their assumed personality characteristics.

All kinds of assumptions are poured into advertising; advertising is less about how people are acting than about how they are dreaming: it reflects the _aspirations_ of the consumer rather than their current situation. This is sometimes expressed as the difference between one's current sense of self and an "ideal self". The opposite, using a representation of a _negative_ future self, is an equally powerful persuasive tactic.

Appealing to consumers' sense of self requires a good deal of speculation, perhaps drawing on psychodynamic theories of selfhood and fantasy, but there is evidence to suggest that the role of consumer goods in modern life is more central to our psychological life than is sometimes assumed in psychology. Some items have incredible salience for the way we construct our identity - and, perhaps, our psychological well-being (Cook, 1992).

Like cognitive/perceptual approaches to advertising, attitudinal astudies of advertising can only speculate about their effectiveness. All the measures taken are indirectly related to _actual_ consumer behavior, and even the sales response to a specific advertising campaign tells us little about the behavior of the individual consumer.

### Rhetorical effects of advertising

A third approach to research on the effects of advertising is to ignore the consumer altogether and focus on the way advertising is created, particularly the use of rhetoric. While this research has been regarded as non-psychological, it's necessary to understand the materials before we can examine their effects.

Much of the research on advertising rhetoric has restricted itself to the analysis of verbal appeals to consumer. However, ads differ tremendously in the amount of verbal information they contain. Increasingly, advertisers work in a visual domain, so studies of rhetoric have had to examine the manipulation of nonverbal info. This is harder to deermine, because visual rhetoric is more reliant on analysts' interpretative skills.

In the 60s, Durand identified four types of rhetorical figure that might be present in an ad: figures of addition, suppression, substitution and exchange.

#### Intertextuality and brand awareness

An advertisement is not a single, independent event; it's a text woven into the cultural fabric, cueing memories of other advertising and product characteristics. Brand awareness is built up through years of viewing and interpretation, and advertising goes beyond the mass media, into our homes and immediate environments. The message contained in a specific ad is therefore hard to isolate from the everyday experiences of the consumer.

Links between advertising can be seen as a form of _intertextuality_. This has the effect of stretching the meaning of an ad into other textual forms, so campaigns can build up meaning thorugh different media. Some ads are extremely hard to decode, but it's been argued that's the point; advertisers actually see the intellectual effort involved in interpreting complex advertising as a selling point. Some ads are remembered specifically _because_ of their lack of information; linking them up with the subsequent television commercials, in one case, requieres extra cognitive work that eventually pays off in terms of recall and recognition.

Other form of intertextual advertising is _product placement_. Thusly, a star becomes a celebrity endorser, and at the same time, the visibility of contemporary consumer goods enhances the realism of the movie. In one study, it was found that the placement had little effect other than reinforcing existing behavior patterns and attitutes. Once again, it seems unlikely that exposure to one single instance of a product will have much impact on long-term behavior.

### Advertising and children

The practice of advertising to children has been hotly debated by psychologists, media and communication experts. Critics of advertising to children argue that children have not developed the cognitive sophistication that enables them to tell advertising apart from other forms of programming, and that even children as old as 12 may misunderstand the nature and function of advertising. Others maintain that children are more sophisticated than cognitive psychologists sometimes think, and that a ban on television commercials is unlikely to have much effect against other forces promoting relentless consumption in contemporary society.

Valkenburg and Cantor (2001) identified four stages that children pass through in their development a customers:

- During infancy (0-2 years), children become interested in brightly coloured television programming (which includes commercials), and by 18 months they start asking for products they've seen advertised in television.
- During the preschool period (2-5 years), children are at their most vunerable to television advertising. They still have a largely literal understanding of television, believing objects depicted in it are real, and they find it hard to resist tempting products.
- In the third phase (5-8 years), children become more sophisticated consumers of media, and by the end of the phase they have begun to display independence in terms of purchasing.
- During the final phase (9-12 years), this independence increases, as children become more critical media users and are attracted toward more adult forms of entertainment. At this stage, peer influence is more important than individual media use, and adult styles of consumption such as brand loyalty begin to appear.

Some issues remain contemptuous within this cognitive/piagetian approach. Firstly, it has been argued that children are able to discriminate between advertising and other forms of programming well before the model claims. Secondly, children's ability to understand the nature and function of advertising. The cognitivist argument is based on general television processing research in general, which portrays children's understanding of television as a simple matter of distinguishing between events on TV as "fantasy" and events around them as "reality". However, most of the research on children's understanding of advertising has focused on their ability to understand the economic principles involved in advertising itself, rather than emantic aspects of individual commercials.

_Advertising literacy_: "understanding" is both the recognition that advertising has a specific source distinct from other television programming, and a recognition of advertising's persuasive intent.

A meta-analysis of studies demonstrated a clear positive correlation between age and comprehension of persuasive intent, although this was less clear when ads were isolated from surrounding programming, suggesting an inability even among older children to identify "advertising" as a genre distinct from television itself. It has been suggested that there's no "magic age" at which an "understanding" great enough to cope with the wiles of advertisers can be said to truly take place, and that in many cases adults would fail the tasks that researchers give to children.

Cognitive maduration plays a part in children's media interaction, inasmuch as children have to develop the perceptual skills to identify formal features on TV. However, arguments that cognitive maduration is the main determinant of advertising awareness fail to explain how young children differ in terms of the products they request. Young children must be identifying with protagonists in commercials, if only on superficial characteristics such as gender, but this indicates the selective processing of advertisements, a task well beyond what the cognitive model predicted for 2 to 5 year olds.

Children spend increasing amounts of time alone, and these boundaries are exploited by advertisers, who emphasise the differences between members of the family rather than the similarities.

## Chapter 8: Young Children and Television

Studies such as the one examining the extraordinary complexity of _pretense_ that young children need to negotiate in order to appreciate _The Sooty Show_ are important for media psychology because they show how sophisticated young children's processing of media can be, and because they present innumerable problems for the crude behaviorism that still underpins much researh on children and television. For many years, the "effects" of media, invariably television, on children have been studied with negligible regard to content. It has generally been assumed that the only possible positive role that television might have is of formal education, as with _Sesame Street_.

### Fantasy versus reality: a simple choice?

The esteem in which fiction has been held has often turned to worry when contemplating its influence on young children. Two broad lines of argument are often advanced in relation to the harmful effects of television on children. The first corresponds to the "magic window" approach - the idea that television is a faithful recreation of reality and that children need to be protected from its harsh truths. The second approach is that all television is artificial (and by implication, worthless trash), and too much of it will simply rot children's brains.

Research into children's discrimination between symbolic representations and naturalistic representations. Many researchers have tried to investigate the cognitive processes by which young children learn to distinguish betwen fantasy and reality, with occassional regard to media (mainly television). However, there are problems with the idea of a simple dichotomy between what is real and what is fantasy, and the role of television in this transition is far from clear. Most people will find themselves on a continuum somewher between these two extremes, and accept that although some television is real much is fantasy. Therefore, the important issue - as far as child development is concerned - is _discrimination_. Successful development requires an awareness of which bits are real and which are fantasy.

#### The development of children's understanding of the fantasy-reality distinction in television

The fantasy-reality distinction is made via a three-stage process. At the first stage (2 to 3 years of age), children fail to make a fantasy/reality distinction. Until they are 3 years old, children fail to imitate actions presented on video, although they have no trouble imitating the same actions when they are presented by a live actor.

The second stage occurs around the ages of 4 and 5, and consists of a flat denial of reality status for anything on television (#TODO: check research on fantasy/reality distinction in children) - it's been called an "impermeable membrane". For example, violence is generally dismissed as "acting", blood as "ketchup", and so on. It is not clear whether children are simply overgeneralising about the artificial nature of television, or whether this is part of the growing child's desire to be seen as more mature, and distancing themselves from childish notions of television as directly representational. Interview data with children aged 4 and younger seems to suggest a literalness in their perception of television content.

Awareness that some programmes are real and others are fantasy seems to arrive at some point between 6 and 7 years (with substantial individual differences). Many researchers attribute this awareness to the onset of "tele-literacy", the process by which children learn to "read" media texts. The clearest way this happens is through the identification of television genres - ads are identified first, at between 3 and 4 years of age, thn cartoons, then news programmes - and eventually being able to distinguish children's from adult's programmes, and more subtle genres.

Doubts have been raised as to the fiability of many developmental theories that are based largely on verbal data, since young children are very unreliable interviewees. Many interview questions may be too abstract for young children to give sensible answers to.
